                    <p>Context Aware Encoding is a technology developed by Brightcove that uses machine learning to optimize encoding settings on a per-content item and delivery context basis. CAE is specifically designed to reduce the storage and bandwidth costs associated with video delivery, but without compromising visual quality.

                    <h2 id="CAE_Presets">CAE presets</h2>
                    <p>By general release of the service, we intend to support three primary use-cases which are in turn encapsulated by three “presets”. The presets consist of ingest profile settings, which are coupled to CAE optimizations tuned for the specific profile.</p>
                    <p>Among the advantages of early participation in the beta is the opportunity to shape how these presets are tuned and optimized, and to propose use-cases not covered below. The three presets currently envisioned for a 1.0 release are summarized in the following table.</p>

                    <p>Once your account has been enabled for CAE, the three profiles listed above will be available to you in the upload tool and ingest profiles sections of studio. By the same token, these profiles can be used with the <a href="/node/17948">Dynamic Ingest API</a>, like any other ingest profile.</p>
                    <h3>Preset Details</h3>
                    <p>A subset of the setings for each of the CAE profiles is listed below. Please note that these recommended settings will evolve over the course of the beta.</p>

                    <p>Below are some of the benefits of switching to dynamic profiles:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improvement in quality of service – Because many videos will be encoded at a lower bitrate, viewer performance should improve: faster load times and less buffering.</li>
                        <li>Reduction in storage and bandwidth costs – Most videos will be encoded at a lower bitrate and an optimum set produced as needed based on the input. Based on our research, on average total size of the renditions are reduced by 40% and less bandwidth consumed by the end user much lower resulting in lower storage and bandwidth costs.</li>
                        <li>Potential increase in visual quality – Because we are analyzing each video and creating content-specific profiles, video with a higher complexity will be encoded with higher bitrates. As a result, there should be less distortion than with a basic static profile.</li>
