                    <p>Context Aware Encoding is a technology developed by Brightcove that uses machine learning to optimize encoding settings on a per-content item and delivery context basis. CAE is specifically designed to reduce the storage and bandwidth costs associated with video delivery, but without compromising visual quality.

                    <h2 id="CAE_Presets">CAE presets</h2>
                    <p>By general release of the service, we intend to support three primary use-cases which are in turn encapsulated by three “presets”. The presets consist of ingest profile settings, which are coupled to CAE optimizations tuned for the specific profile.</p>
                    <p>Among the advantages of early participation in the beta is the opportunity to shape how these presets are tuned and optimized, and to propose use-cases not covered below. The three presets currently envisioned for a 1.0 release are summarized in the following table.</p>
                    <table class="bcls-table">
                        <caption class="bcls-caption--table">CAE Presets</caption>

                    <h3>Using Presets to Encode Content</h3>
                    <p>Once your account has been enabled for CAE, the three profiles listed above will be available to you in the upload tool and ingest profiles sections of studio. By the same token, these profiles can be used with the <a href="/node/17948">Dynamic Ingest API</a>, like any other ingest profile.</p>
                    <h3>Preset Details</h3>
                    <p>A subset of the setings for each of the CAE profiles is listed below. Please note that these recommended settings will evolve over the course of the beta.</p>

                    <h3>How to submit beta feedback</h3>
                    <p>A primary goal during the beta is to capture structured qualitative and quantitative feedback on the visual quality of CAE outputs. At any point during the testing process, you may use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJusVaFzfhPvpBS0jiUMiEeBi6YWqFUaJP1V9R5QGu7zDbfA/viewform">this form</a> to submit feedback on visual quality and to identify bugs. You may submit feedback as often and as frequently as you like.</p>
                    <h3>Advanced testing and custom profiles</h3>
                    <p>Customers interested in tuning or customizing their CAE settings may contact their account manager or solutions engineer (SE). SEs interested in guidance on the customization of CAE ingest profiles can also submit their request on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/brightcove.com/forum/#!forum/dynamic-profiles-beta">CAE beta forum</a>.</p>
                    <p>For a detailed review of custom profile generation and advanced testing of CAE, please review <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14yt8o4zL3Sz6GE1xbpzxWXcGSdQCb1Be6ixReC2cO30/edit">this linked document</a>.</p>
