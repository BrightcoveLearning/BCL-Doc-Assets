                    <p>Context Aware Encoding is a technology developed by Brightcove that uses machine learning to optimize encoding settings on a per-content item and delivery context basis. CAE is specifically designed to reduce the storage and bandwidth costs associated with video delivery, but without compromising visual quality.

                    <h2 id="Benefits_of_Dynamic_Profiles">Benefits</h2>
                    <p>Below are some of the benefits of switching to dynamic profiles:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improvement in quality of service – Because many videos will be encoded at a lower bitrate, viewer performance should improve: faster load times and less buffering.</li>
                        <li>Reduction in storage and bandwidth costs – Most videos will be encoded at a lower bitrate and an optimum set produced as needed based on the input. Based on our research, on average total size of the renditions are reduced by 40% and less bandwidth consumed by the end user much lower resulting in lower storage and bandwidth costs.</li>
                        <li>Potential increase in visual quality – Because we are analyzing each video and creating content-specific profiles, video with a higher complexity will be encoded with higher bitrates. As a result, there should be less distortion than with a basic static profile.</li>
                    </ul>
