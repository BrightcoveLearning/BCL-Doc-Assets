<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To use this guide you'll need:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Camera - A webcam works great</li>
	<li>Encoding software - We'll be using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-media-encoder.html">Flash Media Live Encoder</a> for this guide</li>
	<li><a href="https://app.zencoder.com/signup.html">Zencoder Account</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Account</a></li>
</ul>

<section id="Introduction" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We'll start by sending an API request to Zencoder, which will respond with a stream url and name. We'll then use Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) to publish an RTMP stream. Zencoder will encode the stream and upload the HLS outputs to S3 as specified in the original API request. When we're done, you'll be able to watch your stream via players that support HLS.</p>
</section>

<section id="S3_Setup" class="bcls-section">
<h2>S3 Setup</h2>

<p>You'll need an S3 bucket, so let's set that up now. You can create a new bucket or use an existing one, but keep in mind that you'll be uploading quite a few files into it. In order to allow Zencoder to upload to your S3 bucket, you'll need to add your S3 access key and secret under <a href="https://app.zencoder.com/account/credentials/new?kind=s3">credentials</a>. Make note of the nickname used as you'll be using this to reference those credentials in the request.</p>
</section>

<section id="Send_the_API_request" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Send the API request</h2>

<p>Copy this API request and paste it into the <a href="https://app.zencoder.com/login.html">Request Builder</a>, then edit the S3 bucket for each output to be your own.</p>

<p>This request will create a live stream with 3 HLS outputs targeting different bitrates and an adaptive-bitrate playlist. The adaptive-bitrate playlist will allow devices that support HLS to switch between streams depending on available bandwidth.</p>

<p>Once you've replaced all the instances of <code>YOUR_S3_BUCKET</code> in the request, click "Execute". You should see a successful response appear at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h2>Streaming from FMLE</h2>

<p>Now we will set up streaming from Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE).</p>

<p>Copy the stream URL and stream name into the text fields labeled "FMS URL" and "Stream" in FMLE and click "Connect." You should see the "Connect" button change to "Disconnect". Your stream out of FMLE should at least be the same bandwidth as your highest quality output, so set "Input Size" to 1280x720, "bitrate" to 1200, and "output size" to 1280x720.</p>

<p><img alt="Connect FMLE" class="guides_screenshot" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/zencoder/assets/docs/screenshots/fmle_settings-463abf03a651e35c8dea89b5b65186d6.png" /></p>

<p>If you're on a slower internet connection, you may need to adjust these settings to account for having less bandwidth available. Click "Start" and you should see "Streaming to Primary" in the bottom left hand corner.</p>

<p><img alt="success!" class="guides_screenshot" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/zencoder/assets/docs/screenshots/successful_stream_thumbs-d6a8a7e60cc0acc69131d3e1ecbae736.png" /></p>

<p>Your stream is now being uploaded to Zencoder, where it is encoded into the 3 outputs we specified earlier and uploaded to S3. To view the stream, simply open the master playlist we created in any player that supports HLS. From Quicktime you can open an HLS stream by going to <code>File &gt; Open Location</code> or you can pull the stream up in Safari. Your URL should look like this: <code>http://YOUR_S3_BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com/master.m3u8</code>; just replace the S3 bucket with your own.</p>

<p>There you have it! You should now be streaming an incredibly exciting video of yourself live on the internet. We'll go over adding an RTMP output in a future guide. Make sure to end the stream when you're done!</p>
