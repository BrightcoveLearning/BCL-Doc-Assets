<h2 id="signUp">Signing up for DRM</h2>

<p>This feature requires an additional fee. Video Cloud offers other options for protecting your content across devices. See <a href="/node/6302">Content Protection and Digital Rights Management</a> for more information. Contact your Account Manager about bundling DRM protection so that you can secure your content wherever it plays.</p>
</div>

<div class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="configure">Configuring your Video Cloud account</h2>

<p>Publisher accounts looking to use FairPlay with Video Cloud will need to have their Video Cloud account configured by Brightcove Support. Contact <a href="http://support.brightcove.com/en/contact">Brightcove Support</a> and request that your account be configured to support FairPlay, including your FairPlay Streaming license in the request.</p>
</div>

<div class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="package">Packaging content</h2>

<p>Packaging content with FairPlay requires the use of Video Cloud's Ingest Profiles feature to indicate which renditions should be packaged with FairPlay. The Ingest Profiles feature offers more fine-grained control of the output files than when using the standard transcode settings that are configured for an account. For more information on creating an ingest profile for FairPlay packaging, see <a href="/node/18038#fairplay">Content Security</a></p>
</div>

<div class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="license">Delivering FairPlay Packaged Content</h2>

<p>The Brightcove native players for iOS and tvOS know how to handle FairPlay packaged content, and will take care of most of the details for you. See the <a href="/node/18367">Native Player SDKs documentation</a> for more information.</p>
