        <p>In the Quick Start to Player Management you used curl statements to interact with the API. When an API call was made you were interactively prompted for a password. While this works well for curl, this kind of interactive authentication is not feasible when building an application.</p>
        <p>Here you will learn how you make the API requests using JavaScript and XMLHttpRequest - also know as AJAX - to build web clients for player management operations</p>
        <p>Because the Player Management API is <a href="/node/17916">CORS-enabled</a> and allows basic authentication using your Brightcove login credentials, it is possible to make API requests directly from a web page, as we do in Player Management API samples. Brightcove's other RESTful APIs require authentication via <a href="/node/18376">OAuth</a>. Since the API used to retrieve access tokens is not CORS-enabled (nor are the APIs themselves), you must make requests through a server-side app. See <a href="/node/18132">Using the REST APIs</a> for a guide to building hybrid apps with a web UI and proxy to access the REST APIs. This is the approach we recommend for apps using the Player Management API in production as well, because it is more secure, sending no credentials over HTTP connections.</p>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning"><p>The sample apps referred to on this page are meant as a way for you to explore the basics of the Player Management API. They are not meant to be enterprise ready, deployable apps. For instance, form validation is not exhaustive and passwords are sent NOT using HTTPS.</p></aside>
