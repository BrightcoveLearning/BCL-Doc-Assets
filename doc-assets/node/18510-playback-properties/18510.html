<p class="BCL-aside">This topic applies when using the new Players module UI. For the legacy UI, see <a href="/node/14052">Configuring Player Settings</a>.</p>

<p>The player playback properties can be used to configure how video playback is handled in the player.</p>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<p>To configure the player playback properties, follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Click <strong>Players</strong> in the navigation header to open the Players module.</li>
	<li>Click the link for the player you want to configure.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Playback</strong> in the left navigation menu.</li>
</ol>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="playback properties" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18510-playback-props.png" /></div>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Any changes made to a player may take up to 5 minutes to appear in published players.</p>

<p>The following playback properties can be configured:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#start">Auto-Start Video on Player Load</a></li>
	<li><a href="#preload">Preload Video Before Playback</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="start">Auto-Start Video on Player Load</h2>

<p>The <strong>Auto-Start Video on Player Load</strong> setting controls whether the video will start playing when the player is loaded.</p>

<h3>Browser-specific limitations</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Safari</strong> - Starting with Safari 11.0 (the standard version in MacOS 10.13 High Sierra), autoplay will <strong>not</strong> work. Using the API <code>play()</code> method will also not work until the user has initiated playback.</li>
	<li><strong>Chrome</strong> - Excerpt from <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/09/unified-autoplay.html">blog.chromium.org/2017/09/unified-autoplay.html</a>
	<blockquote cite="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/09/unified-autoplay.html">
	<p>Starting in Chrome 64, autoplay will be allowed when either the media wonâ€™t play sound, or the user has indicated an interest in the media. This will allow autoplay to occur when users want media to play, and respect users' wishes when they don't. These changes will also unify desktop and mobile web behavior, making web media development more predictable across platforms and browsers.</p>

	<p>Not all users have the same preferences for autoplay media, so Chrome 63 will add a new user option to completely disable audio for individual sites. This site muting option will persist between browsing sessions, allowing users to customize when and where audio will play.</p>
	</blockquote>
	</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="preload">Preload Video Before Playback</h2>

<p>The <strong>Preload Video Before Playback</strong> setting controls whether the player will preload video content before the user initiates playback.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Note: For more details, see the <a href="/node/18119#preload_details">preload details section</a> of the Available Attributes document.
</aside>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Preload Video (fastest)</strong> - Indicates that the whole video file could be downloaded, even if the user does not eventually watch the video. On the positive side, if the viewer plays the video, it can start playing immediately. On the negative side, this option will increase bandwidth consumption as the preload/load happens even if the viewer does not play the video.</li>
	<li><strong>Preload Metadata</strong> - Only the video metadata is preloaded. <em>This is the default.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Do not preload</strong> - None of the video is preloaded</li>
</ul>

<p class="BCL-aside">The value for the preload setting in Studio will override the value of the <code>preload</code> attribute value in the <a href="/node/18119">Advanced (In-Page) Embed Code</a>.</p>
