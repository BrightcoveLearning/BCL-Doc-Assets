<p>The Live module can be used to help you broadcast a live event to both desktop and mobile devices. After entering your event information into the Live module, you will be provided with a set of encoder settings that you plug into your on-site encoder. All transcoding is done in the cloud so you don't need a hardware based transcoder.</p>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="prereq">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before you can broadcast an event, the following items are required:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A Video Cloud Pro or Enterprise account with access to the Live module; you can sign up for a Live module trial <a href="http://go.brightcove.com/forms/video-cloud-live-module">here</a></li>
	<li>A camera to broadcast the event</li>
	<li>You must have your own encoding software, for example <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-media-encoder.html">Adobe Flash Live Media Encoder</a> (which can be downloaded for free) or <a href="http://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm">Telestream's Wirecast</a> (see a list of <a href="https://app.zencoder.com/docs/guides/encoding-settings/using-live-streaming#supported-encoders">supported encoders</a>)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Your encoder must output an RTMP stream</li>
	<li>Live broadcasts will experience a 20-30 second delay</li>
	<li>Maximum of 26 continuous event hours</li>
	<li>Streaming must begin within 30 minutes of the event start</li>
	<li>HD is defined as video with a height of 720 and up; SD is video with a height below 720</li>
	<li>Akamai HD must be used as the Content Delivery Network (CDN)</li>
	<li>For users using Internet Explorer, version 10 or later is required</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="homepage">Video Cloud Live module home page</h2>

<p>To access the Live module, open <a href="http://studio.brightcove.com">Video Cloud Studio</a>. You will be required to enter your Video Cloud credentials. After logging in, your Video Cloud account name will appear in the upper right corner of the page. If you have multiple accounts, use the account switcher dropdown to select the account you would like to work with. If the account you select hasn't been enabled for Live, the Live module will open in trial mode.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-homepage.png" /></div>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: For users using Internet Explorer, version 10 or later is required to access the Live module.</p>

<p>The Live module home page contains Planned Events and Completed Events sections.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="eventqueue">Working with planned events</h2>

<p>Planned events are events that have been created but where streaming has not started. The Sort drop down list can be used to sort the events by creation date, event date or name. Navigation at the bottom of the Planned Events section allows scrolling between different pages of events. Each event will display in a tile with the event date and status. A status of <strong>Ready</strong> indicates the event is ready for streaming. A status of <strong>Needs Attention</strong> indicates the event is incomplete and the Start Streaming button will be disabled. This is typically due to the output delivery options not being configured.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-event-tile.png" /></div>

<p>Click on an event name or the <strong>Event Details</strong> button to view the details for an event.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-event-setup-summary.png" /></div>

<p>If an event is incomplete, the Start Streaming button will be disabled. This is typically due to the output delivery options not being configured. Click the <strong>Start Streaming</strong> button to <a href="#start">start your event</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="create">Creating a new event</h2>

<p>To create a new event, follow these steps.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">For a complete step-by-step guide to creating and streaming a live event using the Live App, see <a href="/node/10820">Quick Start: Using the Live Module to Broadcast a Live Event</a>.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>View Details</strong> link to see the rendition details. If you are not sure of the rendition settings at this time, click the <strong>X</strong> button to close the dialog. Your event will be saved without rendition information and you will be required to select a transcoding profile before you can start your event. You can customize any of the output settings and create new transcoding profiles by clicking the <strong>Edit Profile</strong> button. To learn how to create additional transcoding profiles, see <a href="/node/11973">Creating Transcoding Profiles for the Live Module</a>.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: By default, all of the Live module output profiles create RTMP renditions which are not supported by the Brightcove Player. If you are publishing your live event using a Brightcove Player, Brightcove recommends that you create a custom profile and either delete the RTMP renditions or change the RTMP renditions to HLS renditions.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: When working with DVR, you may wish to adjust the amount of DVR time. For information on how to do this, see <a href="/node/11973">Creating Transcoding Profiles for the Live Module</a>.</p>

<p>When done, click the <strong>Save and Close</strong> button to save your event for streaming at a later time or the <strong>Start Streaming</strong> button to <a href="#start">start your live event</a>.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-add-renditions.png" /></div>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Click the <strong>Add An Event</strong> button.</li>
	<li>Add details for your live event and click <strong>Save and Continue</strong>. Note that these values will be associated with the asset in Video Cloud Studio.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Event Name </strong>- top level name for the event; this name is internal to the Live module</li>
		<li><strong>Broadcast Name</strong> - name for the broadcast; Note: it is possible for an event to have multiple broadcasts but using multiple broadcasts is only recommended when using a Smart Player</li>
		<li><strong>Short Description</strong> - description of the event</li>
		<li><strong>Tags</strong> - tags to associate with the event</li>
		<li><strong>Reference ID</strong> - reference ID associated with the event</li>
		<li><strong>Event Date</strong> - planned date of the event; for informational purposes only and has no effect on the event</li>
	</ul>

	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-event-details.png" /></div>

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The Advanced Settings can be used to set the reconnect time and event length for an event. The stream will be kept open for the remainder of the event length or the full reconnect time, whichever is greater, unless you click Stop Streaming in the Live Module.</p>
	</li>
	<li>On the Select a Player dialog, select the player from the drop down list that you would like viewers to use to view your event. The list will display the single video players in your Video Cloud account. Both Brightcove Players and Smart Players are supported. Brightcove Players will have <strong>(New Brightcove Player)</strong> following the player name. Click <strong>Save and Continue</strong>.
	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The copy to clipboard buttons require that Flash is installed and enabled. These buttons do not work when using the Microsoft Edge browser.</p>

	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-select-player.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li>The Your Output Options dialog allows you to select a predefined transcoding profile for the event. Each profile has a set of transcode settings associated with it.
	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The transcoding profiles that appear are based upon your Live module subscription plan.</p>

	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-output-options.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li>After your event has been created, you can view the live event asset inside the Video Cloud Media module and <a href="/node/15473">generate the publishing code</a> for the player that will be used to view your live stream.
	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The live asset that is created inside of the Media module <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> be deleted until the event has finished streaming. Deleting the live asset before the event has started streaming will cause errors inside of the Live module.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="edit">Editing an event</h2>

<p>All live events created using the Live module can be edited. For example, you might want to change the player associated with an event or maybe you need to edit the renditions that will be created for an event. To edit an event, follow these steps.</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Click on the event name or the <strong>Event Details</strong> button to edit.</li>
	<li>Click the appropriate <strong>Edit</strong> button to edit either the video or publishing details.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Update</strong> button to save your changes.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="delete">Deleting an event</h2>

<p>All events in the Planned Events and Completed Events sections can be deleted. To delete an event, follow these steps.</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Rollover the event you want to delete in either the Planned Events or Completed Events section and click the <strong>X</strong> to the right of the event name.

	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-delete-event.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li>Confirm the delete warning.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="start">Starting your live event</h2>

<p>There are two ways to being streaming your live event:</p>

<ul>
	<li>After creating a new event, you can click on the <strong>Start Streaming</strong> button</li>
	<li>Click on the <strong>Start Streaming</strong> button in the Planned Events section</li>
</ul>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Only events that have all required information (indicated by a status of <strong>Ready</strong>) can be started for streaming. If your event status is <strong>Needs Attention</strong>, <a href="#edit">edit the event</a> and make sure all required information is provided.</p>

<p>After you click the <strong>Start Streaming</strong> button, the Live module will return a <strong>Stream URL</strong> and <strong>Stream Name</strong> that you will use as part of your encoder configuration. Enter these values into your encoder, and start your encoder. In the Live Event Player section, you can choose to copy the URL or the embed code for the live event player.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-encoder-config.png" /></div>

<p class="BCL-aside">For a list of supported encoders, see the <a href="https://app.zencoder.com/docs/guides/encoding-settings/using-live-streaming#supported-encoders">Zencoder documentation</a>.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: For the best quality, we recommend configuring your encoder to output a 1280 x 720, 2500 Kbps stream.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The copy to clipboard buttons require that Flash is installed and enabled. These buttons do not work when using the Microsoft Edge browser.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="onair">Working with on air events</h2>

<p>The Video Cloud Live module home page displays On Air events at the top of the page. On Air events are events where streaming is currently in progress.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-onair-events.png" /></div>

<p>All on air events can be edited. To edit an event, click on the event thumbnail. Click the <strong>Show</strong> link in either the Video Details Summary or the Live Event Player section to view the details. Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to make changes. The page will also display a preview of the event. The dropdown list below the preview window can be used to select a rendition to preview.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The Flash plugin must be enabled for the preview player to display the live stream. If Flash is not enabled, a <strong>Processing Stream</strong> message will appear and the live preview will not display. When using Google Chrome, the <strong>Processing Stream</strong> message may appear instead of the live stream preview.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-onair-status.png" /></div>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: You can click the <strong>Hide</strong> link in the preview window to hide the live event player. This helps reduce bandwidth and CPU usage when you are streaming and encoding on the same machine.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Stop Streaming</strong> button to end your event. When you have stopped streaming your event, you can <a href="#trim">trim and save</a> the live event to your Video Cloud account.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: It is important to make sure you close/stop your encoder when the live stream is complete. Leaving a connection open between any encoder and Brightcove, even when no data is being sent, may result in unexpected connection charges.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="pastevents">Working with completed events</h2>

<p>The Video Cloud Live module home page displays all completed live events. The drop down list can be used to sort the events by event date or event name. Navigation at the bottom of the Completed Events section allows scrolling between different pages of events.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-completed-events.png" /></div>

<p>To view the details for a completed event, click on an event name.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="multiple">Using multiple broadcasts per event</h2>

<p>The Live module offers the ability to have multiple broadcasts per event. This feature allows you to:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Retry an event if something goes wrong, without having to create an entirely new event.</li>
	<li>Setup an event and test it in advance before running the "real" event, again without having to create an entirely new event.</li>
	<li>Setup an event once and have recurring broadcasts within it.</li>
</ol>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Using multiple broadcasts is only recommended when using a Smart Player. If you are publishing an event using a Brightcove Player, Brightcove recommends creating new events. In this case, using the reference id in place of the video ID in the publishing code will allow you to use the same publishing code for different events. For information on working with Reference IDs, see <a href="/node/18117">Using Reference IDs</a>.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: While it is possible to click New Broadcast after an event has completed to start a new broadcast, Brightcove has seen cases where when using a Brightcove Player, old stream content displays instead of the current stream. Brightcove recommends creating new events vs. creating a new broadcast.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: When using the reference ID in the player publishing code, Brightcove recommends that there is at least one hour between events due to the Playback API cache.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-reuse-event.png" /></div>

<p>When the <strong>New Broadcast</strong> button is clicked, the Live module will generate a new Stream Name and Stream URL that must be entered into your encoder. The player publishing code for the event will not change.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="trim">Trimming and saving your live event</h2>

<p>When you have stopped streaming your event, the Live module offers the ability to trim and save your live event to your Video Cloud account. Click the <strong>Create Clip</strong> button to open the trimming dialog. The <strong>Download Archive</strong> link allows you to download an archive of the event.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-save-vod.png" /></div>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The option to trim and save the live event to a separate video is only available for 7 days. After that, the Save button will not be available and there will be no way to archive the live event. If you want to keep your live content for longer than a week, we recommend that you trim and save the event as a video-on-demand asset in your Video Cloud account.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: When an event is trimmed and saved, it will not have a pushlished date. By deactivating and then activating the video, a published date will be assigned.</p>

<p>The trimming dialog allows you to trim the beginning and end of the live event. Drag the handles on the timeline to define which part of the event will be saved. The In and Out times can also be set by entering values in the text fields. Click <strong>Next</strong> when finished.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-trim.png" /></div>

<p>Enter a<strong> Video Name</strong>, <strong>Short Description</strong>, <strong>Tags</strong> and <strong>Reference ID</strong> and then click <strong>Save</strong>. These values will be associated with the trimmed asset in Video Cloud Studio. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-trim-metadata.png" /></div>

<p>The video will be transcoded and saved into your Video Cloud account. When the transcoding is complete, expand the broadcast details and click on the <strong>Preview Video</strong> button to preview your live event in a player.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-preview-video.png" /></div>

<p>You can click the Create Clip button multiple times to create multiple clips of your broadcast. This allows you to trim and save as many times as you want for each broadcast, saving the clips as separate VOD assets in your media library.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="analytics">Live event analytics</h2>

<p>Once the live event has started, the Live module UI will display the total number of views for the event.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node11062-event-analytics.png" /></div>

<p>The <a href="/node/10104">Performance Report</a> can be used to see the number of video views and viewed minutes for the live event. The <a href="/node/16461#live">Billing Module</a> can be used to see the live module hours used over time.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="trouble">Troubleshooting live stream issues</h2>

<p>If you are having issues with your encoder, for example, if you receive a "Failure to connect to primary server" error, make sure that port 1935 is open on your network. Zencoder uses RTMP to accept the input stream and it uses this port.</p>

<p>The Video Cloud Live module can be used to view stream information and can be helpful when troubleshooting live stream errors. Brightcove Support is also available to help you troubleshoot live stream issues.</p>

<div class="BCL-subsection">
