<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Dynamic Ingest can pull videos from your Amazon S3 bucket. If your S3 content is accessible to <strong>Everyone</strong>, there is nothing you need to do. If your content is protected, however, you will need to add a bucket policy allowing Dynamic Ingest to access your videos. This document explains how to do that.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Note:
<ul>
	<li>Currently DI can only pull media from regions that are configured for AWS Signature Version 2. Until further notice, please use one of these regions.</li>
	<li>Video masters may be pulled from <code>S3://</code> or <code>HTTP/HTTPS</code> addresses, but images and webVTT files <strong>must be pulled from <code>HTTP/HTTPS</code> addresses</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting the S3 Policy</h2>

<p>To set up your policy to allow Dynamic Ingest to access your videos, go to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/console/">AWS Console</a>. Select your bucket on the left side of the screen, then click "properties". On the last row click <strong>Add bucket policy</strong>. Below is our recommended policy:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AddPerm",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::395540211253:root"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKETNAME/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1295042087538",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::749779118921:user/videocloud-ingestion"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObjectAcl",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKETNAME/*"
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">The first entry in the <code>Statement</code> array is for the ingestion of videos, while the second is for ingestion of <a href="images.html">images</a> and <a href="webvtt.html">WebVTT</a> files.</aside>

<p>There is only <strong>one change you must make</strong> to this bucket policy before it's ready to go:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Replace <strong><em>{BUCKETNAME}</em></strong> with the name of your bucket. Leave the <code>/*</code> at the end of the <code>Resource</code> line, as that will apply the policy to every file within the bucket.</li>
	<li>Optionally, replace the Action array with the actions you want to allow. Valid actions that Video Cloud may need are:
	<h4>Object Permissions - first action array in the example above</h4>

	<h4>Bucket Permissions - second action array in the example above</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>s3:GetBucketLocation - allow Video Cloud to get the location of the bucket (US, EU, Asia, etc.)</li>
		<li>s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads - allow Video Cloud to view any multipart uploads currently happening on the bucket</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Video Cloud does not need any write permissions.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
