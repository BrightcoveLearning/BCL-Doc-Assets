<p>There may be times when you want to replace the source file for a video. One common case is when you need to edit a video that was already published. If you delete the video and re-upload, you will have to re-enter all of the video metadata and you will lose any video analytics associated with the video.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The ability to replace the video source file is available only to Professional and Enterprise accounts. If you are interested in this feature, please contact your Account Manager.</p>

<p>While the new renditions are being created, the video will remain playable using the existing renditions.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: You cannot replace the source file for videos that have been shared to your account.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Video file names (including the extension) must not exceed 120 single-byte (60 double-byte) characters. If it does, the video will be ingested successfully, but you will not be able to retranscode it later.</p>
