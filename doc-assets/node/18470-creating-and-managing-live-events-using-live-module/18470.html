<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Live module can be used to help you broadcast a live event to both desktop and mobile devices. After entering your event information into the Live module, you will be provided with a set of encoder settings that you plug into your on-site encoder. All transcoding is done in the cloud so you don't need a hardware based transcoder.</p>

<p <li class="language-editable BCL-aside">>Depending on your Live subscription, you may have the ability to create events, channels or both. Typically, events are created to stream shorter length, one time or recurring events. Channels are typically used when delivering 24/7 live events.</p>

<p <li class="language-editable BCL-aside">>Note: Live streaming support is available only for Video Cloud Pro and Enterprise publishers.</p>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="advanced">Configuring advanced options</h2>

<p>When creating a new event, advanced options can be configured. To configure the advanced options, click the <strong>ADVANCED OPTIONS</strong> link when creating the event.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-advanced-options.png" /></div>

<p>The following options can be configured:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Reconnect Time</strong> - If the encoder is disconnected, this is the amount of time that the live stream will be kept available. This setting has no effect on how soon the encoder must be started when a new event is created.</li>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Enable Server Side Ad Insertion (SSAI)</strong> - Enables server side ad insertion.

<h2 id="intro_recurring">Introduction to recurring events</h2>

<p>Selecting the <strong>Create this as a recurring event using a Static Entry Point (SEP)</strong> option allows for a long-running live stream that can be activated and deactivated while keeping the same entry point URL and playback URL. When using recurring events, the streaming endpoint URL and video ID will not change.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>The following limitations apply when working with recurring events:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="language-editable">The <strong>Convert event to video asset when complete</strong> option is not available. An alternative is to use clipping to archive the full live event as a VOD. Clips can be created up until the next activation of the stream, or for 24 hours, whichever is shorter. When the stream is re-activated, previous recording sessions are removed from the server and can no longer be clipped.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Job settings can not be modified, they are currently tied to the settings that initially created the recurring event.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Activating the stream can take up to 60 seconds for the event to become available. Some encoders have built-in retry (Wirecast, Elemental, etc.) so the encoders will reconnect as soon as the entry point is available.</li>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Reconnect Time</strong> is still applicable for recurring events on encoder disconnects. If the <strong>Reconnect Time</strong> is reached, the recurring event will be set to a deactivated state. Brightcove recommends deactivating a stream when a job completes and setting the <strong>Reconnect Time</strong> to an acceptable window of time to wait in the event of a disconnect (input hour costs are accrued during this wait period).</li>
	<li class="language-editable">You should always stop the encoder before deactivating a recurring event. Accounts are allocated a finite number of recurring events. If the limit is reached, you will need to stop one of your recurring events before you can create a new one. If you have reached the maximum number of recurring events and attempt to create another one, an error will be returned.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="work_recurring">Working with recurring events</h2>

<p>To create a recurring event, select the <strong>Create this as a recurring event using a Static Entry Point (SEP)</strong> option when creating a live event and then click <strong>Create Event</strong>.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-recurring-event-selected.png" /></div>

<p>When the recurring event is created, it will appear in the <strong>Standby</strong> tab on the Manage Events page.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-standby-tab.png" /></div>

<p>The recurring event status can be one of:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Not Activated</strong> - Recurring event has been created and streaming has never started</li>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Waiting</strong> - Recurring event is activated and waiting for stream</li>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Streaming</strong> - Recurring event in progress</li>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Disconnected</strong> - Recurring event is in the process of being stopped</li>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Deactivated</strong> - Recurring event is deactivated</li>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Archived</strong> - Recurring event has been archived</li>
</ul>

<h3>Activating a recurring event</h3>

<p>Activating a recurring event makes the job available for streaming. The recurring event should be activated before the encoder is started. To activate a recurring event:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li class="language-editable">Click on the <strong>Standby</strong> tab.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Click on the event name to open the event in the Control Room.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Click <strong>Activate</strong>.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Start your encoder.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the recurring event is activated, it will move from the <strong>Standby</strong> tab to the <strong>Live</strong> tab.</p>

<h3>Deactivating a recurring event</h3>

<p>Deactivating a recurring event disables the job for streaming. When the event is over, the recurring event should be deactivated. To deactivate a recurring event:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li class="language-editable">Click on the <strong>Live</strong> tab.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Click on the event name to open the event in the Control Room.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Click <strong>Deactivate</strong>.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Stop your encoder.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Archiving a recurring event</h3>

<p>Archiving a recurring event permanently deactivates the job so it can't be enabled for streaming. Eventually the event will be deleted. Only events where streaming was started can be archived. If a recurring event was created and streaming never started, a <strong>Cancel</strong> button will appear vs. an <strong>Archive</strong> button.</p>

<p>To archive a recurring event:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li class="language-editable">Click on the <strong>Standby</strong> tab.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Click on the row for the event to select it.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Click <strong>Archive</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="controlroom">Viewing live event info using the Control Room</h2>

<p>The Control Room page is used to view information about a live event. When you create a new live event and streaming begins, the Control Room page will open. A preview of the event will appear in the player. The Control Room page is also displayed when you click on an event on the Manage Live Events page.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-control-room.png" /></div>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-analytics.png" /></div>

<p>Output drift displays the output drift graph and is only displayed when an event is in progress. Output Drift measures the healthiness of the stream. Output drift is defined as the difference between the wall clock vs. stream timestamps (TS). In live streaming, ideally, the wall clock should run at the same pace as stream TS, if the stream TS arrives slower than real time this means that there is a problem (bottleneck) in the system.</p>

<p>Input drift displays the input drift graph and is only displayed when an event is in progress. Input drift measures the healthiness of the input stream. Input drift is defined as the difference from the input timestamp and the real time clock.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="rtmp">RTMP</h3>

<p>The RTMP section can be used to add RTMP Outputs. This allows the live stream to be sent to other RTMP entry points. This can be used to send the live to stream to Facebook or YouTube for example.</p>

<p <li class="language-editable BCL-aside">>Note: RTMP Outputs are not available in the Live UI when using recurring events (static entry points).</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-rtmp.png" /></div>

<p>Enter the <strong>RTMP Output URL</strong> and the <strong>Rendition</strong> to send. Note that the format of the output URL may change depending on where the RTMP stream is being used. For more information, see <a href="/node/18726">Using Live RTMP Outputs to Stream to Facebook and YouTube</a>.</p>

<h2 id="clip">Creating a clip</h2>

<p>Clips can be created while the event is in progress or after the event has ended. If clips can't be created, a message will appear when hovering over <strong>Create Clip</strong> in the left navigation. For information on creating a clip, see <a href="/node/18551">Creating a Video Clip Using the Live Module</a>.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note:
<ul>
	<li class="language-editable">
	<p>Streams are available for clipping for 24 hours after the live event has ended.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="language-editable">
	<p>For Static Entry Point (recurring) streams: If during the 24 hours after a stream, the stream is re-activated with a 2nd stream, the clipping will only be available for the content of the 2nd stream. The 1st stream will be cleared at that point, and there is no way to create create clips from it anymore, even if it is under 24 hours after the stream was deactivated.</p>

<h2 id="ad">Requesting an ad</h2>

<p>If the <strong>Enable Server Side Ad Insertion (SSAI)</strong> option was selected when the event was created, the Control Room page will display a <strong>Goto Ad</strong> button. When clicked, the length of the ad break can be selected.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-goto-ad.png" /></div>

<p>Click <strong>Insert</strong> to insert an ad break into the live stream. If the ad doesn't fill the entire ad break time, the fill slate will be displayed.

<h2 id="captions">Captions</h2>

<p>Brightcove Live currently supports 608 captions in-band (inside h.264 headers). If captions are inside the h.264 input signal (correctly signaled in the user_data packet) those are passed through to the h.264 outputs.</p>

<p>If you are using a broadcast Elemental live encoder you can get captions from SDI (EIA-608/CEA-608) or other sources (SCTE-20, SCC, Teletext, DVB-Sub, Ancillary, ARIB, TTML, SCTE-27, STL, SRT, SMI) and put them into the h.264 stream that you send to us. Other broadcast grade encoders probably can do the same, but we have not formally tested them.</p>

<p>WebVTT captions are <strong>not</strong> supported for Live streams.</p>

<p>The Brightcove Player has support for in-band captions.</p>
