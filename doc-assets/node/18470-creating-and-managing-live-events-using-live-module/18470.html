  <h2 id="Introdution">Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Live module can be used to help you broadcast a live event to both desktop and mobile devices. After entering your event information into the Live module, you will be provided with a set of encoder settings that you plug into your on-site encoder. All transcoding is done in the cloud so you don't need a hardware based transcoder.</p>

	<p class="BCL-aside">Depending on your Live subscription, you may have the ability to create events, channels or both. Typically, events are created to stream shorter length, one time or recurring events. Channels are typically used when delivering 24/7 live events.</p>

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Live streaming support is available only for Video Cloud Pro and Enterprise publishers.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before you can broadcast a live event, the following items are required:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A Video Cloud Pro or Enterprise account with access to the Live module</li>
	<li>A camera to broadcast the event</li>
	<li>You must have your own encoding software, for example <a href="http://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm">Telestream's Wirecast</a></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Your encoder must output an RTMP stream</li>
	<li>Live broadcasts will experience a 20-30 second delay</li>
	<li>Streaming must begin within 30 minutes of the event start (default-level account setting)</li>
	<li>For users using Internet Explorer, version 10 or later is required</li>

-->

<p>To create a new event, follow these steps.</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>From the Manage Live Events page click the <strong>Create Event</strong> button or click <strong>Create Live Event</strong> or <strong>Create Live Channel</strong> in the left navigation. The Create Live Event or Create Live Channel page will open. The properties when creating events and channels are the same. The screen shots in this document cover creating an event.

	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-new-event.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li>Enter the event details:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Event Name</strong> - Name for the event; this name will also appear in the Media module if the video is saved as a video asset</li>
		<li><strong>Short Description</strong> - Description of the event</li>
		<li><strong>Tags</strong> - Tags to associate with the event; tags will be assigned to the video if the video is saved as a video asset</li>
		<li><strong>Reference ID</strong> - Reference ID for the event; must be unique</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Any required custom fields for the account will be displayed. Assign values to the custom fields.</li>
	<li>Select a <strong>Live Ingest Profile</strong>. The dropdown list will list all Live ingest profiles. The ingest profile will control the quality and number of live renditions that are created. Clicking the <strong>Manage Profiles</strong> link will open the ingest profile editor in another browser tab. Note that you must be an account administrator to access the ingest profile editor. Click the <strong>RENDITIONS</strong> link to view the renditions that will be created using the selected ingest profile.
	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: For details on the standard Live ingest profiles, see the <a href="/node/18619">Standard Live Ingest Profiles</a> document.</p>

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: For information on creating live ingest profiles, see <a href="/node/18471">Creating Custom Live Ingest Profiles</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Convert event to video asset when complete</strong> to save a VOD version of the live video to your Video Cloud account. When this option is selected, the highest quality rendition from the selected <strong>Live Ingest Profile</strong> is used as the source for the VOD video. The default ingest profile for the account is used when creating renditions. The video will be available once the ingestion process is complete.
	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: This option is not supported when using a recurring event.</p>
	</li>
	<li>(Optional) Click <strong>ADVANCED OPTIONS</strong> and <a href="#advanced">configure the advanced options</a>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Start Streaming</strong> to start the live event. The <a href="#controlroom">Control Room page</a> will open with details about the live event including the <strong>Streaming Endpoint (RTMP URL)</strong> and <strong>Stream Name</strong> which will be used by your encoder.
	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: By default, the encoder must be started within 30 minutes from when a new event is created.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Click the <strong>Stop Streaming</strong> button to end the event.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Make sure the encoder is closed/stopped when the live stream is complete. Leaving a connection open between any encoder and Brightcove, even when no data is being sent, may result in unexpected connection charges.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="advanced">Configuring advanced options</h2>

<p>When creating a new event, advanced options can be configured. To configure the advanced options, click the <strong>ADVANCED OPTIONS</strong> link when creating the event.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-advanced-options.png" /></div>

<p>The following options can be configured:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Reconnect Time</strong> - If the encoder is disconnected, this is the amount of time that the live stream will be kept available. This setting has no effect on how soon the encoder must be started when a new event is created.</li>
	<li><strong>Enable Server Side Ad Insertion (SSAI)</strong> - Enables server side ad insertion. Ads are configured as part of the <a href="/node/18588">live settings</a>.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Fill Slate</strong> - Select a fill slate. The fill slate will be displayed when there are gaps in a live stream ad break that cannot be filled with a dynamically-served ad. Create fill slates as part of the <a href="/node/18588">live settings</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Create Cloud DVR</strong> - Enables DVR capability. You must also use a player with the <a href="/node/18089">Live DVRUX Plugin</a>.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>DVR Window</strong> - The amount of time, in seconds, to keep in the live DVR manifest.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>RTMP Credential</strong> - Select the RTMP credential used to secure the Streaming Endpoint. Note this option will only appear if at least one RTMP credential was created as part of the <a href="/node/18588">Live settings</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>RTMP IP whitelist</strong> - Enter a set of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the RTMP endpoint. This controls who can connect to the RTMP endpoint.</li>
	<li><strong>Region</strong> - The Amazon Web Services (AWS) region to use. To reduce latency, you should select the region that is closest to where your encoder is located. The following regions are supported:
	<ul>
		<li>Oregon (US West)</li>
		<li>Virginia (US East)</li>
		<li>Tokyo (Asia Pacific)</li>
		<li>Singapore (Asia Pacific)</li>
		<li>Sydney (Asia Pacific)</li>
		<li>Mumbai (Asia Pacific)</li>
		<li>Frankfurt (EU)</li>
		<li>Ireland (EU)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Content Encryption</strong> - Select the type of encryption to apply to the live stream:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>None</strong> - No encryption is applied</li>
		<li><strong>AES-128</strong> - Secure the stream using AES-128 encryption. If this option is selected, you must enter your <strong>Encryption Key</strong>.
		<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Clips can't be created from encrypted live streams.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Enable stream status notifications</strong> - When checked, enter a <strong>Notification URL</strong>. An http request will be made to the <strong>Notification URL</strong> when there is a change in the job status. This can be used to update a server in response to changes in the job status.</li>
	<li><strong>+ Add multi CDN configuration</strong> - Enter a <strong>label</strong> and <strong>URL</strong> for additional CDNs. This is a whitelist of CDNs that are allowed to ask our primary CDN for the video segments. You are responsible for configuring the secondary CDN correctly.</li>
	<li><strong>Create this as a recurring event</strong> - Allows a single live stream to be created and then activated/deactivated when needed. For information, see the <a href="#intro_recurring">Introduction to recurring events</a> section of this document.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click <strong>Edit Configuration </strong> to view/edit the API request that will be made to create the live stream. Caution should be used when editing the API call directly.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="intro_recurring">Introduction to recurring events</h2>

<p>Selecting the <strong>Create this as a recurring event</strong> option allows for a long-running live stream that can be activated and deactivated while keeping the same entry point URL and playback URL. When using recurring events, the streaming endpoint URL and video ID will not change.</p>

<p>All accounts have the following limits by default:</p>

<table class="bcls-table">
	<thead class="bcls-table__head">

<p>Contact your account manager if you need to increase the number of recurring events for your account.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>The following limitations apply when working with recurring events:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Convert event to video asset when complete</strong> option is not available. An alternative is to use clipping to archive the full live event as a VOD. Clips can be created up until the next activation of the stream, or for 24 hours, whichever is shorter. When the stream is re-activated, previous recording sessions are removed from the server and can no longer be clipped.</li>
	<li>Job settings can not be modified, they are currently tied to the settings that initially created the recurring event.</li>
	<li>Activating the stream can take up to 60 seconds for the event to become available. Some encoders have built-in retry (Wirecast, Elemental, etc.) so the encoders will reconnect as soon as the entry point is available.</li>
	<li><strong>Reconnect Time</strong> is still applicable for recurring events on encoder disconnects. If the <strong>Reconnect Time</strong> is reached, the recurring event will be set to a deactivated state. Brightcove recommends deactivating a stream when a job completes and setting the <strong>Reconnect Time</strong> to an acceptable window of time to wait in the event of a disconnect (input hour costs are accrued during this wait period).</li>
	<li>You should always stop the encoder before deactivating a recurring event. Accounts are allocated a finite number of recurring events. If the limit is reached, you will need to stop one of your recurring events before you can create a new one. If you have reached the maximum number of recurring events and attempt to create another one, an error will be returned.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="work_recurring">Working with recurring events</h2>

<p>To create a recurring event, select the <strong>Create this as a recurring event</strong> option when creating a live event and then click <strong>Start Streaming</strong>.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-recurring-event-selected.png" /></div>

<p>When the recurring event is created, it will appear in the <strong>Standby</strong> tab on the Manage Events page.</p>

<div>
<p><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node18470-standby-tab.png" />Recurring events also have a Static Entry Point status:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>WAITING</strong> - Recurring event is deactivated</li>
	<li><strong>READY</strong> - Recurring event is activated and waiting for RTMP stream</li>
	<li><strong>PENDING_DEACTIVATION</strong> - Recurring event in the process of being deactivated</li>
	<li><strong>ARCHIVED</strong> - Recurring event has been archived</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<h3>Activating a recurring event</h3>

<p>Activating a recurring event makes the job available for streaming. The recurring event should be activated before the encoder is started. To activate a recurring event:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Click on the <strong>Standby</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Click on the event name to open the event in the Control Room.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Activate</strong>.</li>
	<li>Start your encoder.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the recurring event is activated, it will move from the <strong>Standby</strong> tab to the <strong>Live</strong> tab.</p>

<h3>Deactivating a recurring event</h3>

<p>Deactivating a recurring event disables the job for streaming. When the event is over, the recurring event should be deactivated. To deactivate a recurring event:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Click on the <strong>Live</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Click on the event name to open the event in the Control Room.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Deactivate</strong>.</li>
	<li>Stop your encoder.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Archiving a recurring event</h3>

<p>Archiving a recurring event deactivates the job so it can't be enabled for streaming. Eventually the event will be deleted. To archive a recurring event:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Click on the <strong>Standby</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Click on the row for the event to select it.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Archive</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">

<p>Output drift displays the output drift graph and is only displayed when an event is in progress. Output Drift measures the healthiness of the stream. Output drift is defined as the difference between the wall clock vs. stream timestamps (TS). In live streaming, ideally, the wall clock should run at the same pace as stream TS, if the stream TS arrives slower than real time this means that there is a problem (bottleneck) in the system.</p>

<p>Input drift displays the input drift graph and is only displayed when an event is in progress. Input drift measures the healthiness of the input stream. Input drift is defined as the difference from the input timestamp and the real time clock.</p>

  <h2 id="captions">Captions</h2>
	<p>Brightcove Live currently supports 608 captions in-band (inside h264 headers). If captions are inside the h264 input signal (correctly signaled in the user_data packet) those are passed through to the h264 outputs.</p>

	<p>If you are using a broadcast Elemental live encoder you can get captions from SDI (EIA-608/CEA-608) or other sources (SCTE-20, SCC, Teletext, DVB-Sub, Ancillary, ARIB, TTML, SCTE-27, STL, SRT, SMI) and put them into the h264 stream that you send to us. Other broadcast grade encoders probably can do the same, but we have not formally tested them.</p>

	<p>WebVTT captions are <strong>not</strong> supported for Live streams.</p>

	<p>Brightcove Player has support for in-band captions.</p>
