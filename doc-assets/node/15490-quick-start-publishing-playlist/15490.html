<p>After completing this Quick Start you should be able to:</p>

</ul>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="edit">Editing player settings to support a playlist</h2>

<p>When publishing playlists, there are some player properties that can be configured that control player sizing, whether the playlist auto advances to the next video and if the playlist appears next to the player. To configure the playlist related player properties, follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Open the <strong>Players</strong> module.</li>
	<li>Click on the player name to open the player properties.</li>
	<li>Locate the <strong>Settings</strong> section and click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
	<li>Set the player properties used to control the playlist behavior:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Display Playlist</strong> - When <strong>Enabled</strong>, will display the videos in the playlist on the right side of the player.&nbsp;Note that a maximum of 20 videos will be displayed when this option is selected. This example shows a player with <strong>Display Playlist</strong> set to <strong>Enabled</strong> and the <strong>Playlist Version</strong> set to <strong>V2</strong>.
		<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node15490-v2-playlist-example.png" /></div>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Auto Advance to Next Video</strong> - When set to Yes, will advance to the next video in the playlist when the current video finishes playing</li>
		<li><strong>Play On Select</strong> - When set to Yes, will cause the video to play when loaded, even if the previous video in the player was paused</li>
		<li><strong>Playlist Version</strong> - V2 will hide/show the playlist, when the viewer clicks on V1 that will always displays the playlist</li>
		<li><strong>Adjust Player Dimensions for Playlist</strong> - When checked, will modify the player size to accommodate the display of the playlist (only available with Playlist Version V1)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save changes. Remember to publish the player so the changes appear in the published player.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="publish">Publishing a playlist</h2>

<p>The process to publish a playlist is the same as it was for publishing a video. To publish a playlist:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Open the <strong>Media</strong> module.</li>
	<li>In the side navigation panel, click the <strong>All Playlists</strong> link.</li>
	<li>Click the checkbox next to the playlist to publish.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Publish and Embed</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select the player to use and the type of embed code.</li>
</ol>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: When publishing a playlist using the Standard (iframe) publishing code, the iframe width must be larger than 640px for the playlist to appear.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: When using the <strong>Standard (iframe)</strong> embed code, the playlist has a show/hide button and is automatically sized and positioned. When using the <strong>Advanced (in-page)</strong> embed code, you must insert the playlist as an HTML <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element and write your own CSS to position and size the playlist. This gives you full control over the playlist's display. In the latter case, the playlist does not even need to be adjacent to the player if you don't want it to be. The <strong>In-page embed player</strong> section of the <a href="/node/18055#In_Page_embed_player">Implementing Playlists</a> document has substantial content on formatting and styling the playlist.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-task">
<h2 id="handson">Hands-on Task: Publishing a playlist</h2>

<p>In this task you will create a new player, edit player settings to support playlists and then publish a playlist.</p>

<h3>Editing player settings to support playlists</h3>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: If you select the <strong>Responsive</strong> sizing option, the Standard (iframe) code works well and both the player and playlist are responsive. If you use the Advanced (in-page embed) code, the player will be responsive, but the playlist will not.</p>
