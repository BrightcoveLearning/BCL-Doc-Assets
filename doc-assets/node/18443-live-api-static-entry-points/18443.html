<p>The Static Entry Points (SEP) feature allows for a long-running live job that can be activated and deactivated while keeping the entry point URLs and playback URLs static and re-usable. This feature allows for customers to configure their encoder in their facilities or the field and allows the customer to create their own scheduling logic for live channels or programs.</p>
