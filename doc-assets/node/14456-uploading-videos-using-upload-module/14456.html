<p>The Upload module uses a dynamic ingest process to retrieve and transcode video content. When you select a file to upload, Video Cloud uses a pull-based process to pull the content from a storage location where it then uses the Zencoder transcoding service to transcode the content.</p>

<p>To access the Upload module, click <strong>Upload</strong> in the navigation header.</p>

<h2 id="profile">Selecting an ingest profile</h2>

<p>Before uploading videos, select an ingest profile. The ingest profile contains the transcode settings that will be used when the videos are transcoded. The list of available ingest profiles will vary based upon how your Video Cloud account is configured. In the following screen shot, both <strong>LEGACY</strong> and <strong>DYNAMIC DELIVERY</strong> profiles are available.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14456-select-profile.png" /></div>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: To learn more about Dynamic Delivery, see <a href="/node/18476">Overview of Dynamic Delivery</a>.</p>

<p>The video renditions that are created are based upon the ingest profile that is selected. For specific details on the Brightcove supplied ingest profiles, see one of the following documents:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For profiles listed under the <strong>LEGACY</strong> grouping, or if no groupings are displayed, see the <a href="/node/18041">Standard Ingest Profiles</a> document</li>
	<li>For profiles listed under the <strong>DYNAMIC DELIVERY</strong> grouping, see the <a href="/node/18386">Standard Ingest Profiles for Dynamic Delivery and Context Aware Encoding</a> document</li>
</ul>

<p>The image dimensions for the video still and thumbnail images are based upon the image dimensions specified in the ingest profile.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: For information on creating additional ingest profiles, or setting a default profile for your account, see <a href="/node/15628">Managing Ingest Profiles</a> or <a href="/node/16840">Creating Ingest Profiles for Dynamic Delivery</a>.</p>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="upload">Uploading videos</h2>

<p>After an ingest profile has been selected, you are ready to upload videos. Videos can be uploaded using one of these methods:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong> - Drag files from the file system to the Upload module page. The entire page below the navigation header becomes the drop zone. When the file is dropped, the upload process will begin.

	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14456-upload-file.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li><strong>File selection dialog</strong> - Click the <strong>Browse for Videos</strong> button to open a file selection dialog and then browse and select files to upload.</li>
	<li><strong>Remote URL</strong> - Click the <strong>Enter URL</strong> button to specify the location of the source file. Source files may reside on a public DropBox folder or Amazon S3 storage location. Click <strong>Add to Queue</strong> when finished.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14456-url-to-ingest.png" /></div>
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="BCL-aside">Notes:
<ul>
	<li>There is no file size limit. Brightcove has tested with uploads as large as 100GB without any issues.</li>
	<li>You can not use a Google Drive URL, because Google Drive does not generate direct links to video files.</li>
	<li>When uploading from Dropbox, if the URL ends with "?dl=0", you may need to change it to "?dl=1" before the file will upload.</li>
	<li>Video file names (including the extension) must not exceed 120 single-byte (60 double-byte) characters. If it does, the video will be ingested successfully, but you will not be able to retranscode it later.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Once the files have been selected, the file upload will begin. To cancel the upload, click the <strong>Cancel Upload</strong> button. Click <strong>Dismiss</strong> to remove the file entry from the page. The ingest profile and a subset of the video properties can be edited before the transcoding takes place.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Ingest Profile</strong> - Ingest profile that will be used for the video</li>
	<li><strong>Status</strong> - Video status
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Active</strong> - Video can be played</li>
		<li><strong>Inactive</strong> - Video can't be played</li>
	</ul>

	<p>By default, when a video is uploaded, the status is set to Active unless required fields are missing. If required fields are missing, a message will be displayed with the required fields highlighted in red. Videos with missing required fields can still be uploaded but they will remain Inactive until all of the required fields have values. For more information on working with required fields, see <a href="/node/15531">Setting Required Fields for Videos</a>.</p>

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: There is an account level setting, <strong>Default to Inactive</strong>, which can be used to set all uploaded videos to be inactive. For more information, see <a href="node/14055#upload">Managing Account Settings</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Video Title</strong> - Title for the video</li>
	<li><strong>Short Description</strong> - Short description for the video</li>
	<li><strong>Tags</strong> - Tags associated with the video</li>
	<li><strong>Reference ID</strong> - Video reference ID</li>
	<li><strong>Video Projection</strong> - Select <strong>360 Degree</strong> to indicate a video is a 360 degree video. For more information on working with 360 degree videos, see <a href="/node/16784">Working with 360-Degree Videos</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Move to Folder</strong> - Select a folder to assign the video to. For more information on working with folders, see <a href="/node/15095">Organizing Videos Using Folders</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Custom Fields</strong> - Any custom fields that have been marked as required will appear.</li>
