<p>The Upload module uses a dynamic ingest process to retrieve and transcode video content. When you select a file to upload, Video Cloud uses a pull-based process to pull the content from a storage location where it then uses the Zencoder transcoding service to transcode the content.</p>

<p>To access the Upload module, click <strong>Upload</strong> in the navigation header.</p>

<h2 id="profile">Selecting an ingest profile</h2>

<p>Before uploading videos, select an ingest profile. The ingest profile contains the transcode settings that will be used when the videos are transcoded. The list of available ingest profiles will vary based upon how your Video Cloud account is configured. In the following screen shot, both <strong class="notranslate">CONTEXT AWARE ENCODING</strong> and <strong class="notranslate">DYNAMIC DELIVERY</strong> profiles are available.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14456-select-profile1.png" /></div>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: To learn more about Dynamic Delivery, see <a href="/node/18476">Overview of Dynamic Delivery</a>.</p>

<p>The video renditions that are created are based upon the ingest profile that is selected. For specific details on the Brightcove supplied ingest profiles, see one of the following documents:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong class="notranslate">LEGACY</strong> (or if no groupings are displayed - See <a href="/node/18041">Standard Ingest Profiles for Legacy Transcoding</a></li>
	<li><strong class="notranslate">DYNAMIC DELIVERY</strong> and <strong class="notranslate">CONTEXT AWARE ENCODING</strong> - See <a href="/node/18386">Standard Ingest Profiles for Dynamic Delivery and Context Aware Encoding</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The image dimensions for the poster and thumbnail images are based upon the image dimensions specified in the ingest profile.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: For information on creating additional ingest profiles, or setting a default profile for your account, see <a href="/node/15628">Managing Ingest Profiles</a>.</p>

<h2 id="upload">Uploading videos</h2>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Before uploading videos, make sure the appropriate ingest profile has been selected.</p>

<p>Videos can be uploaded using one of these methods:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong> - Drag files from the file system to the Upload module page. The entire page below the navigation header becomes the drop zone. When the file is dropped, the upload process will begin.

	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14456-upload-file1.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li><strong>File selection dialog</strong> - Click <strong>Browse for Videos</strong> to open a file selection dialog and then browse and select files to upload.</li>
	<li><strong>Remote URL</strong> - Click <strong>Enter URL</strong> to specify the location of the source file. Source files may reside on a public DropBox folder or Amazon S3 storage location. Click <strong>Add to Queue</strong> when finished.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14456-url-to-ingest1.png" /></div>
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="BCL-aside">Notes:
<ul>
	<li>There is no file size limit. Brightcove has tested with uploads as large as 100GB without any issues.</li>
	<li>You can not use a Google Drive or YouTube URL, because they do not generate direct links to video files.</li>
	<li>When uploading from Dropbox, if the URL ends with "?dl=0", you may need to change it to "?dl=1" before the file will upload.</li>
	<li>Video file names (including the extension) must not exceed 120 single-byte (60 double-byte) characters. If it does, the video will be ingested successfully, but you will not be able to retranscode it later.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Once the files have been selected, the file upload will begin. To cancel the upload, click <strong>Cancel Upload</strong>. Click <strong>Dismiss</strong> to remove the file entry from the page. Click <strong>Edit</strong> to view the ingest profile and a subset of the video properties. The ingest profile can be changed if the video transcoding has not started. The following video properties can be edited:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Status</strong> - Video status

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Active</strong> - Video can be played</li>
		<li><strong>Inactive</strong> - Video can't be played</li>
	</ul>

	<p>By default, when a video is uploaded, the status is set to Active unless required fields are missing. If required fields are missing, a message will be displayed with the required fields highlighted in red. Videos with missing required fields can still be uploaded but they will remain Inactive until all of the required fields have values. For more information on working with required fields, see <a href="/node/15531">Setting Required Fields for Videos</a>.</p>

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: There is an account level setting, <strong>Default to Inactive</strong>, which can be used to set all uploaded videos to be inactive. For more information, see <a href="node/14055#upload">Managing Account Settings</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - Title for the video</li>
	<li><strong>Short Description</strong> - Short description for the video</li>
	<li><strong>Tags</strong> - Tags associated with the video</li>
	<li><strong>Reference ID</strong> - Video reference ID</li>
	<li><strong>Video Projection</strong> - Select <strong>360 Degree</strong> to indicate a video is a 360 degree video. For more information on working with 360 degree videos, see <a href="/node/16784">Working with 360-Degree Videos</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Enable offline playback</strong> - When checked, enables the video to be saved locally and viewed offline when using applications created using the device SDKs. This option will only appear if the account is enabled for offline playback.</li>
	<li><strong>Move to Folder</strong> - Select a folder to assign the video to. For more information on working with folders, see <a href="/node/15095">Organizing Videos Using Folders</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Custom Fields</strong> - Any custom fields that have been marked as required will appear.</li>
</ul>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="defaultprops">Setting a default folder and tags</h2>

<p>When uploading videos, a folder and tags for the videos being uploaded can be specified. The folder dropdown list will display a list of all the folders that have been created in the Media module. Click <strong>+ Create Folder</strong> to create a new folder and assign the video(s) to the new folder. When creating a new folder:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Name is limited to 100 characters</li>
	<li>Folder names must be unique within an account</li>
	<li>Illegal character: /</li>
</ul>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14456-create-folder.png" /></div>

<p>When a folder is selected, all uploaded videos will be added to that folder. For information on creating and assigning videos to folders using the Media module, see <a href="/node/15095">Organizing Videos Using Folders</a>.</p>

<p>Tags can also be assigned to videos as they are uploaded. Enter a comma-separated list of tags to assign to videos.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14456-add-tags1.png" /></div>

<p>After selecting a folder or adding tags, click <strong>Apply to All</strong> to save the changes. Note that the folder and tags will be applied to all videos that are uploaded, in the process of being uploaded or where the upload has finished and the video is still displayed in the Upload module (<strong>Dismiss</strong> button hasn't been clicked).</p>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="mobile">Uploading videos from mobile devices</h2>

<p>The Media module is written entirely in HTML5 and can also be used on tablet and mobile devices. This allows you to shoot video with a mobile device and upload it to your Video Cloud account. To upload content from a mobile device, open the Upload module and select an ingest profile. When you click <strong>Browse for Videos</strong>, the photos application on the device will open. Select the videos to upload and click done. The videos from the mobile device will begin uploading and the progress will be displayed on your device.</p>

</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="errors">Common upload errors</h2>

<p><strong>The difference between the request time and the current time is too large.</strong></p>

<p>This error will occur when the system time on the machine uploading videos is not set correctly. This usually happens after a time change. Make sure your machine is set to the correct time.</p>
