    <p>The In-Page Expeience API allows you manage in-page experiences programmatically, making it particularly useful for CMS integrations, to allow users to create manage experiences from their own CMS instead of going to Gallery in Studio.</p>
    <p>This quick start provides a sample implementation that allows users to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get all in-page experience templates for an account</li>
      <li>Create a basic experience from the selected template</li>
      <li>Select either a playlist or list of videos to add to the experience</li>
      <li>Update the experience with the selected videos/playlist</li>
      <li>Publish the experience</li>
    </ol>
