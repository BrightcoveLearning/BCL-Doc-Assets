<p>It is possible that iOS may download unwanted segments causing excessive bandwidth usage. In the situation where <code>autoplay</code> is enabled, segments will be downloaded even if <code>preload</code> is set to <code>none</code>. The only way to prevent this is to not use the <code>autoplay</code> attribute.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Note: There has been some misunderstanding that setting the <code>preload</code> attribute to <code>none</code> will prevent downloading of segments. This is NOT true.</aside>

<p>When a user switches from inline playback to fullscreen mode, the iOS native player is used instead of the Brightcove player. This is expected behavior. It allows the player to take advantage of the entire device screen.</p>
