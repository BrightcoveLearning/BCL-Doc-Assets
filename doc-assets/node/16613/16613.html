<p>The Native Player SDKs now support the following next generation DRM solutions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Native Player SDKs for iOS and tvOS support <a href="/node/16576">Apple FairPlay Streaming</a> technology for delivering encrypted HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) video content.</li>
	<li>The Native Player SDK for Android supports <a href="/node/10073">Google's Widevine Modular</a> technology. This is the latest version of Google's DRM platform for protecting video playback.</li>
</ul>

<p>These solutions leverage the latest DRM technologies, are built into the operating systems and deliver a superior viewing experience while maintaining secure content protection.</p>

<p>Existing applications with Widevine Classic integrations will continue to work as they have, however, we strongly encourage customers to begin testing with the new FairPlay and Widevine Modular solutions and transition as soon as possible. Be aware that the Widevine Classic Client may not work with newer versions of the mobile operating systems, as announced in the <a href="https://www.widevine.com/product_news.html">Widevine Product News</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on how to migrate to these technologies, see the <a class="video-cloud-only" href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/mobile-sdks/guides/drm.html">Content Security with the Native Player SDKs</a><a class="perform-only" href="/node/18213">Content Security with the Native Player SDKs</a> document.</p>

<h2 class="BCL_conceptTitle" id="data">Questions</h2>

Please reach out to us through the <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brightcove-native-player-sdks">SDK Developer Forums</a> for technical questions, or to your account manager for concerns.</p>
