    <p>If you are not familiar with RESTful APIs, they have some common charactistics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Requests are made by sending an HTTP request, using different methods such as <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>, depending on the kind of operation performed.</li>
      <li>The response is usually in the form of a <a href="/node/18289">JSON</a> string, which any programming language can parse into native data types.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The beauty of REST is that RESTful APIs are not dependent on any particular programming language. As long as you can make HTTP requests and parse JSON responses, the API does not care what language you are using.</p>
