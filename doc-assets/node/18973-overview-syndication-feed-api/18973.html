    <p>The Brightcove Syndication Feed API is a public API for retrieving MRSS feeds created using the <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/overview-public-social-syndication-api">Syndication Configuration API</a>.</p>
    <p>The Syndication Configuration API can also be used to retrieve feeds, but the Feed API is different in that it requires no authentication - anyone having the right URL can retrieve the feed.</p>
    <p>The primary use cases for retrieving feeds using one API or the other are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you only want to host the feed yourself, for subscribers, for example, then you would use the Syndication Configuration API to retrieve the feed.</li>
      <li>If you have syndication partners who you wish to give the feed to use and host in whatever way they wish, you can give the Feed API URL to retrieve feeds directly.</li>
    </ul>
