<p>The video availability properties can be used to control the dates and times that a video can be viewed. Geo filtering can be used to control which countries have the ability to view the video.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"><strong>Notes:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>The video availability properties are only available to Enterprise and Professional accounts.</li>
	<li>Scheduling a video has no effect on whether a video is, or becomes, active or inactive. Scheduling only affects videos that are active.</li>
	<li>Geo-filtering and scheduling properties can also be be added using the <a href="/node/18372">CMS API</a> when you <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/cms-api/v1/doc/index.html#api-videoGroup-Create_Video">create</a> or <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/cms-api/v1/doc/index.html#api-videoGroup-Update_Video">update</a> a video.</li>
	<li>Some publishers have requested the ability to geo filter videos to US military bases as well as the US. To support this, there is a <strong>US Military</strong> option. While there is no 100% reliable way to identify a military base, when an IP that resolves to a .mil domain is encountered, and is not in the US, it will be identified as coming from a US military base rather than its actual country of origin. .mil addresses that are in the US will still be identified as "us".</li>
</ul>

<p>To view and edit the availability properties for a video, open the Media module, click the video title link and locate the <strong>Availability</strong> section.</p>

<h2 id="geofilter">Configuring geo filtering</h2>

<p>Geo filtering can be used to control which countries can, and cannot, play the video.</p>

<div class="BCL-aside">Notes:
<ul>
	<li>The ability to use player geo filtering is a feature available to Enterprise and Professional accounts for an additional fee. Contact Brightcove if you would like to upgrade your account to include geo filtering.</li>
	<li>Geo filtering can also be <a href="/node/15616">applied to players</a>. Video Cloud will apply both player and video geo-filtering policies - if a country is excluded by either, the video will not be available there.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>To set the geo filtering properties for a video:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Select <strong>Allow viewing from the following countries</strong> or <strong>Prevent viewing from the following countries</strong>.

	<li>Enter the appropriate country names. As you type, the country list will be filtered.
