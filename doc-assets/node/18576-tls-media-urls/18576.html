    <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) protects data transferred over the internet by encrypting it. (TLS is a successor to SSL.) The process is largely transparent to users - the only difference is that URLs use the HTTPS protocol instead of HTTP.</p>
    <p>Video Cloud supports TLS for all media delivery on these terms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Those using Brightcove CDNs can  <a href="https://help.brightcove.com/en/contact">Contact Brightcove Support</a> to have their accounts configured for either <strong>HTTPS + HTTP</strong> or for <strong>HTTPS-only</strong> delivery.</li>
      <li>Those using other CDNs (sometimes called BYO CDNs) can request these options from their CDN (if they are supported).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether you need TLS depends on a couple of factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How important the security of the media content is to you - in other words, how concerned you are about it being stolen.</li>
      <li>Whether the site(s) where you deploy your videos loads over HTTPS - if it does, then then your videos and video assets should also load over HTTPS; if they do not, they may fail to load or generate warnings in the viewer's browser.</li>
    </ul>
