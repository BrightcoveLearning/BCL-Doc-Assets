    <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) protects data transferred over the internet by encrypting it. (TLS is a successor to SSL.) The process is largely transparent to users - the only difference is that URLs use the HTTPS protocol instead of HTTP.</p>
    <p>Video Cloud supports TLS for all media delivery on these terms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Those using Brightcove CDNs can  <a href="https://help.brightcove.com/en/contact">Contact Brightcove Support</a> to have their accounts configured for either <strong>HTTPS + HTTP</strong> or for <strong>HTTPS-only</strong> delivery.</li>
      <li>Those using other CDNs (sometimes called BYO CDNs) can request these options from their CDN (if they are supported).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether you need TLS depends on a couple of factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How important the security of the media content is to you - in other words, how concerned you are about it being stolen.</li>
      <li>Whether the site(s) where you deploy your videos loads over HTTPS - if it does, then then your videos and video assets should also load over HTTPS; if they do not, they may fail to load or generate warnings in the viewer's browser.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Changes_in_TLS_support">Changes in TLS support</h2>
    <p>Following the recommendations of internet security experts, Brightcove change its support for TLS as detailed below.</p>
    <section class="bcls-subsection">
      <h3>What is the change?</h3>
      <p>As of June 30, 2018, Video Cloud will no longer provide support for TLS 1.0 or 1.1. Going forward, only HTTPS connections using the TLS 1.2 encryption protocol will be supported.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="bcls-subsection">
      <h3>Why is Brightcove deprecating older TLS versions?</h3>
      <p>The security of customer data is a top priority for Brightcove. These changes are unfolding across our industry, and many of our technology partners and peers have already taken the steps to disable early TLS. These changes are necessary to maintain best practices and, in part, to ensure that updated compliance requirements from the PCI Security Standards Council are met.</p>

    <section class="bcls-subsection">
      <h3>When will Brightcove stop supporting older TLS?</h3>
      <p>June 30th, 2018 is the deadline to disable SSL/early TLS. Going forward all secure connections will be made using TLS 1.2.</p>

      <h3>What specific endpoints are changing on the 30th?</h3>
      <p>Below find the list of services that will be affected as of the 30th. To the extent that any unlisted endpoints accept early TLS, customers should assume that this is unsupported, and that this is subject to change at any time.</p>
