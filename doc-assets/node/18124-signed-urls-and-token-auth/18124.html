<p>If you are delivering premium or confidential content, you will be looking for all ways to ensure it remains secure. You do not want end users to be able to copy video URLs or continue to play back content without the proper authorization. Brightcove supports VOD signing of HLS MP4, and DASH urls. Signing is supported for both Brightcove House and BYO CDN configurations with Akamai, Fastly, Cloudfront, and JOCDN.</p>
