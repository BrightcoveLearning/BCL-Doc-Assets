<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>If you are delivering premium or confidential content, you will be looking for all ways to ensure it remains secure. You do not want end users to be able to copy video URLs or continue to play back content without the proper authorization. Brightcove supports VOD signing of RTMP, HLS, and DASH urls.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note the following limitations:
<ul>
	<li>HLS and DASH are supported for accounts on Akamai only.</li>
	<li>Signed MP4 and Smooth URLs are <strong>not</strong> supported.</li>
	<li>For accounts that have been enabled for <a href="/node/17949">Dynamic Delivery</a>, URL signing for all VOD types is supported, currently on Akamai only.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>The following table lists the requirements for using Token Auth with HLS content in the Brightcove Player. Note that all requirements must be met to use Token Auth.</p>

<table class="bcls-table">
	<caption class="bcls-caption--table">Requirements for Token Auth</caption>
	<thead class="bcls-table__head">
		<tr>
			<th>Requirement</th>
			<th>Explanation</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody class="bcls-table__body">
		<tr>
			<td>Your account must be using the latest release of HLS support. For Video Cloud customers, Support can enable this for your account, but existing videos will need to be retranscoded to use the latest release of the HLS format.</td>
			<td>Brightcove's implementation of token authentication depends on HLS manifests being served from the CDN. For Video Cloud, this requires the account to be enabled for the latest release of HLS.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="video-cloud-only">
			<td>You must ingest titles with one of the following:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/node/17949">Dynamic Ingest</a></li>
				<li><a href="/node/14456">The Studio Upload module</a></li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>The latest release of HLS is only supported via these ingest methods.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>You must be delivering HLS via the Akamai CDN.</td>
			<td>Currently, the only token authentication mechanism supported for HLS in the Brightcove Player is Akamai Token Authentication 2.0.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>You must be using Akamaiâ€™s Adaptive Media Delivery (AMD) product and follow instructions provided by Brightcove to configure it correctly.</td>
			<td>The current solution depends on AMD features to tokenize segment and manifest URLs.</td>
