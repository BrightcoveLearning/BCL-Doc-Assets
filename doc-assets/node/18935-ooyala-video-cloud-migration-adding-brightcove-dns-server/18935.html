    <p>In order to use the <a href="/node/18905">Playback Adapter</a> that will allow your Ooyala players to deliver content from Video Cloud, and/or to use the <a href="/node/18907">CMS Connector</a> that allows you to use some operations of the Backlot API to manage your media in Video Cloud, two things must happen:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>First:</strong> contact your Account Manager to initiate the process. Your Account Manager will need to get IP addresses from you and will help you find them if you don't know how to do it. Your Account Manager can also help you with the steps explained in the rest of this document that you must perform.</li>
      <li>What you need to do for each computer and device that will be using the Playback Adapter or CMS Connector is to add a Brightcove DNS server that will redirect requests sent to ooyala.com resources to the appropriate Brightcove APIs. The steps for doing this are detailed in the sections that follow.</li>

    <p>The above steps may not work if your computer/device is on VPN, because the VPN server may override your DNS server settings with its own. If this happens or you have other issues with setting up the Brightcove DNS server, <a href="/node/18632">contact Brightcove Support</a>.</p>
