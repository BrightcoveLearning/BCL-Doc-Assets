    <p>When your CMS users are embedding a video or playlist player in a page, you want to give them as much flexibility as possible in the generation of the Brightcove player embed code so they can control the look and feel of the Brightcove player on the web page, but not expect them to be HTML or JavaScript experts.</p>
    <p>This topic provides guidelines on how to do that. The audience for this document is primarily Brightcove partners, but will be useful to anyone integrating Video Cloud or the standalone Brightcove Player with your CMS.</p>

    <h2 id="Player_embed_dialog_behavior">Player embed dialog behavior</h2>
    <p>There should be a dialog allowing the user to control the formatting of the player on the web page. This dialog should allow the user to set the fields listed below. The assumption is that the user has already selected a Brightcove account and a video or playlist prior to this dialog being displayed. Otherwise, selection of the Brightcove account and video or playlist should occur first as described in <a href="#appendix_a">Appendix A</a> below.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Player</strong>: The user should be able to choose a player from the available Brightcove players. If they are embedding a video player, then only non-playlist enabled players should be available to choose from. If they are embedding a playlist player, then only playlist enabled players should be available to choose from.</li>
      <li><strong>Autoplay</strong>: The user should be able to enable/disable Autoplay. Default is disabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Mute</strong>: The user should be able to enable/disable Mute. Default is disabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Embed Type</strong>: The user should be able to choose between iFrame and Javascript embed code.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>For a video player, the default should be Javascript.</li>
          <li>For a playlist player, the default should be iFrame.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Sizing</strong>: The user should be able to select between Responsive<sup><strong><a href="#note1-1">[1-1]</a></strong></sup> or Fixed sizing<sup><strong><a href="#note1-2">[1-2]</a></strong></sup>.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>For a video player, the default should be Responsive.</li>
          <li>For a playlist player:
            <ol type="i">
              <li>If iFrame, the default should be Responsive.</li>
              <li>If Javascript, the default should be Fixed.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong>: The user should be able to select the Aspect Ratio<sup><strong><a href="#note1-1">[1-1]</a></strong></sup>.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>The choices are:
            <ul>
              <li><code>16:9</code></li>
              <li><code>4:3</code></li>
              <li><code>Custom</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Default should be <code>16:9</code>.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Width, Height</strong>:The user should be able to enter Width and Height<sup><strong><a href="#note1-1">[1-1]</a></strong></sup>.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>If Aspect Ratio is <strong>16:9</strong> or <strong>4:3</strong>, the <strong>Height</strong> field should be greyed out and automatically calculated based on <strong>Width</strong> and <strong>Aspect Ratio</strong>.</li>
          <li>Default values should be <code>640</code> for <strong>Width</strong> and <code>360</code> for <strong>Height</strong> when Aspect Ratio is Custom.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
