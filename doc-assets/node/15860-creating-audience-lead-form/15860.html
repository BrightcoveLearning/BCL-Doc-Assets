<p>Lead forms can be used to capture viewer information during video playback. Audience lead forms allow you to select from a set of fields and the form data is saved locally in Video Cloud. Custom lead forms allow you to enter custom HTML and are typically used when the form HTML was generated from a marketing automation platform. For more information on creating lead forms with a marketing automation platform, see the document for your platform:</p>
