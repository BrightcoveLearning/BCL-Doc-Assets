<p>There are a number of ways that videos can be downloaded from a Video Cloud account. Videos can be downloaded by publishers using the Media module and APIs and publishers can also add a download link allowing viewers to download content.</p>

<p>This topic is broken up into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#mediamodule">Downloading videos using the Media module</a></li>
	<li><a href="#cmsapi">Accessing video properties using the CMS API</a></li>
	<li><a href="#link">Creating a download link for video files</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mediamodule">Downloading videos using the Media module</h2>

<p>You can download a rendition of a video using the Video Cloud Studio Media module. If the cloud icon next to the video name in the Media module is grey (<img alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14363-legacy-icon.png" />), the video was ingested using a legacy ingest profile and both MP4 and HLS renditions can be downloaded in the Media module. A green cloud icon (<img alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14363-dd-icon.png" />) indicates that the video was ingested using Dynamic Delivery and MP4 renditions can be downloaded. The Social module can also be used to download videos that were ingested using Dynamic Delivery. See the <a href="/node/16344#download">Downloading videos</a> section of the Social documentation for details.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The Video Files section in the video properties page will also indicate what type of ingestion profile was used.</p>

<p>To download a video uploaded to Video Cloud, follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Open the <strong>Media</strong> module.</li>
	<li>Click the link for the video you want to edit.</li>
	<li>Locate the <strong>Video Files</strong> section.</li>
	<li>Check the type of transcoding that was used:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Dynamic Delivery</strong> - Right-click on the <strong>Dimensions</strong> link for the rendition to download</li>
		<li><strong>Legacy</strong> - Right-click on the <strong>Format</strong> link for the rendition to download</li>
	</ul>

	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14363-click-download-link.png" /></div>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>It is important to understand that URLs for renditions and images are not fixed. Brightcove reconfigures the storage of media assets from time to time and when this happens, URLs for specific assets will change. If you are relying on hard-coded URLs to these assets, the links may break at some point. The best way to prevent links to media from breaking is to retrieve them from Video Cloud at runtime using the CMS API.</p>

<h2 id="cmsapi">Accessing video properties using the CMS API</h2>

<p>The CMS API can be used to retrieve metadata, including video URLs, for any video in a Video Cloud account. Development skills are required to use the CMS API. For information on accessing video properties using the CMS API, see the <a href="/node/18019">Using the CMS API: Retrieve Video Data</a> developer document.</p>

<p>Brightcove Learning Services has also created a sample CMS API app that you can use to get download links: <a href="/node/18302">CMS API Sample: Download Links</a>.</p>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="link">Creating a download link for video files</h2>

<p>If you have development skills, it is possible to place a download link in the player control bar to give viewers the option of downloading content.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node14363-download-plugin.png" /></div>

<p>You can also display a download link as a player overlay or below the player. For more information on how to do this, including sample code, see <a href="/node/18273">Brightcove Player Sample: Download Video Plugin</a>.</p>
