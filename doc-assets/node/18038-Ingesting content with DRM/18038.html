<p id="mapi_read_methods">On December 31, 2017, the <strong>read</strong> methods of the <strong>Media API</strong> were fully retired.</p>

<p id="mapi_write_methods">On June 30, 2017, Brightcove retired the <strong>write methods</strong> exposed by the <strong>Media API</strong> (e.g., <code>update_video</code>).</p>

<p id="batch_provisioning">On June 30, 2017, Brightcove ceased supporting the <strong>FTP Batch Provisioning System</strong> and the <strong>content ingest methods of the Media API</strong>. The <strong>Aspera upload method</strong> ceased to be supported at the same time.</p>

<p id="ugcmethods"><strong>Deprecation of Media API read methods find_videos_by_user_id and find_videos_by_campaign_id. </strong>Effective January 31, 2012,<strong> </strong>Brightcove deprecated support for the Video Cloud Media API read methods <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_user_id </span>and <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_campaign_id</span>. These methods were used together with the old Consumer Generated Media module in Brightcove 2. For current best practices for managing user-generated content, see <a href="http://node/3188">User Generated Content</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Deprecation of Media API read methods find_videos_by_text and find_videos_by_tag. </strong>Effective December 31, 2011,<strong> </strong>Brightcove deprecated support for the Video Cloud Media API read methods <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_tag</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_text</span>. We encourage you to use the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">search_videos</span> method for video searches rather than using the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_video</span> read methods. The <span style="font-family: Courier New;">search_videos</span> method offers more flexible search and sorting options than the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_video</span> methods, and is especially more flexible than the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_text</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_tags</span> methods.</p>

<p><strong>Flash Player Support. </strong>Effective May 15, 2011, Brightcove no longer supports Flash Player 9 for using the Video Cloud Studio or Video Cloud players. Video Cloud Studio users should upgrade to Flash Player 10. <a href="http://blog.brightcove.com/en/2011/04/end-support-flash-player-9">Read more about why we're doing this and what it means to you</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Content type for Media API responses</strong>. The content type for responses returned by the Video Cloud Media API is <span style="font-family: Courier New;">application/json</span> and not <span style="font-family: Courier New;">text/html</span>. Using the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">application/json</span> content type should provide superior security. The change in content type should not affect how any JSON returned in a Media API method is parsed.</p>

<p><strong>Error returned by Media API search_videos method for invalid sort_by arguments.</strong> If you call the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">search_videos</span> method in the Media API with an invalid <span style="font-family: Courier New;">sort_by</span> argument, the error returned currently includes the text of the invalid argument. Calls that include illegal characters (such as &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, \, %, or +) in the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">sort_by</span> argument will return an error message with the illegal characters escaped.</p>
