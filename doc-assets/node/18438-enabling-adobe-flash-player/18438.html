<p>The latest version of Video Cloud Studio is written in HTML 5 and does not require the Adobe Flash Player. However, if you
  are using some features in Studio, these features do require the Flash Player
  to display correctly. Some examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Live module preview player</li>
</ul>

<p>If you open one of these pages and the Flash Player is not enabled, a blank page will display.</p>

<p>Adobe has published a series of documents that will walk you through the process of enabling the Flash Player for your browser:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/enabling-flash-player-chrome.html">Chrome</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/enabling-flash-player-safari.html">Safari</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/enabling-flash-player-firefox.html">Firefox</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/flash-player-issues-windows-10-edge.html">Edge</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/install-flash-player-windows.html">Internet Explorer</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Brightcove recommends following the steps for your browser to enable the Flash Player. After enabling the Flash Player, restart
  your browser and then the legacy pages in Video Cloud Studio should display correctly.</p>
