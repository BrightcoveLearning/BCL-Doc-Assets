<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Deleting players is a non-reversible action. To err on the side of caution, this page is non-functional (the <em>Delete Players</em> button does nothing).</aside>

<p>You can get the functional, non-styled <a href="https://gist.github.com/bcls/9351324">Delete Player code</a> and place it on a local web server if you need a delete players app.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">This sample app is meant as a way for you to explore the basics of the Player Management API. It is not meant to be an enterprise ready, deployable app. For instance, form validation is not exhaustive and passwords are sent NOT using HTTPS.
<p>To learn about the general approach concerning the architecture of this sample app, specifically authentication and AJAX implementations, see the <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/search?search=xmlhttprequest">Examples using HTTPRequest</a>.</p>

<h2>Default player</h2>

<p>Although you can delete the default player, a new default player will automatically be recreated instantly. This is so there is always at least one player in each account, which provides an optimal UI experience.</p>

<h2>App architecture</h2>

<p>The high-level application logic for this app is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Gather necessary data to access account</li>
	<li>On button click, perform AJAX call to retrieve all player info</li>
	<li>On AJAX call success perform the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Call function to display a checkbox, followed by player name, for all players</li>
		<li>Call function that continuously watches checkboxes for checked status and keeps an array of IDs for all checked players</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>On button click, start process to loop over selected player IDs and perform AJAX call to delete each player</li>
	<li>On AJAX call success perform the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Clear the existing list of players</li>
		<li>Display the returned <code>204</code> status code that indicates successful deletion</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>No response data is returned on a player delete, so the successful delete code of <code>204</code> is retrieved and displayed from the AJAX object for each deletion:</p>
