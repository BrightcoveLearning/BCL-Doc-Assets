<h2>Try new version</h2>
<!-- <p>If a pre-release version is available, the easiest way to try out a pre-release version is to go to the player in the Studio Players module, edit the Settings, use the version selector (screenshot is an example only, use the latest pre-release version):</p>

<p>You can update a player to the pre-release version by using a curl statement. A quick overview of curl can be found at the top of the <a href="/node/18268">Quick Start: Player Management</a>. In the document there is a specific section on how to <a href="/node/18268#updatePlayer">update your player</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the curl command to update your player, where you substitute appropriate values for <strong>YOUR_EMAIL</strong>, <strong>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</strong> and <strong>YOUR_PLAYER_ID</strong>.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-json">curl \
                          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
                          --user YOUR_EMAIL \
                          --request PATCH \
                          --data '{
                            "player": {
                              "template": {
                                "version": "6.7.1"
                              }
                            }
                          }' \
                          https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/players/YOUR_PLAYER_ID/configuration
                        </code>
                        </pre>

<p>In most cases you will want to publish the player, which can be done with the following curl statement. Again, you will need to substitute correct values where indicated.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-json">curl \
                          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
                          --user YOUR_EMAIL  \
                          --request POST \
                          https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT/players/YOUR_PLAYER_ID/publish
                        </code>
