<h3>Supported Features</h3>
<p>
	The live experience is enhanced with the following features supported with the Native SDKs:
</p>
<h4>Out-of-the-box cloud DVR controls</h4>
<p>
	DVR Live goes above and beyond the classic approach to Live Streaming by allowing viewers to take control of their viewing experience. Providing the viewer full control over playback, DVR Live enables your audience to seek to past moments in a VOD styled setting. Then, with the click of a button, seamlessly jump back to the live action to continue watching in real time.
</p>
<h4>Brightcove Live server-side ad insertion (SSAI)</h4>
<p>
	Server-side ad insertion (SSAI) allows you to stitch ads into your live stream on the server side, bypassing any ad blockers. For details about how to setup SSAI with your live streams, see the <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/node/17763">Brightcove Live API: Server-Side Ad Insertion</a> document.

			Using the in-cloud transcoding capabilities of Zencoder, you can deliver live events with Brightcove's Zencoder Live Cloud Transcoding API. A remote asset video is created in Video Cloud Studio and the Zencoder API is used to generate a set of stream URLs.  For details, see the following:

			If you don't want to use the features provided by Video Cloud, you can still use the Brightcove Zencoder API to ingest an RTMP stream, convert it to multiple bitrate streams in RTMP or HLS, and publish them to a CDN location of your choice. For details, see the <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/node/18331">Brightcove Zencoder</a> documentation.
