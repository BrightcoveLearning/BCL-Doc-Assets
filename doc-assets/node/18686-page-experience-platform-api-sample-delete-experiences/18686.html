    <p>Deleting in-page experiences programatically is a straightforward process. The API only allows deleting one experience at a time, but this sample uses iteration to delete a group of experiences identified by keywords in the name.</p>

      <p>Note that delete operations are <strong>not</strong> reversible, so be sure that you test any app that deletes entities from Video Cloud or Gallery throroughly on junk data before putting it into production.</p>
      <p>For your protection, this app does not let you use your own account or change the criteria for selecting items to delete.</p>
