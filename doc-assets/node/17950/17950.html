<h2>Best practices</h2>

<p>To insure good performance and results with Dynamic Ingest, it's important that you follow these best practices!</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
<ul>
	<li>A 20 request per minute limit on each account for total requests across DI and the CMS API (CMS API or Ingest API requests)</li>
	<li>A limit of 100 concurrent DI jobs per account</li>
	<li>Ingest content smaller than 100GBs per file (if you need to ingest larger files please contact your Account Manager)</li>
	<li>If you are ingesting files in batches, limit batches to 100 and wait for the previous batch to complete processing before continuing</li>
	<li>Validate <a href="../../ingest-profiles-api/getting-started/api-overview.html">ingest profile</a> changes before ingesting full batches</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<p>If you have a high volume of videos to ingest on a regular basis, you will need to combine your ingest app with a <a href="../../media-management/guides/get-status-di.html">notification receiver</a> to know when you need to pause and resume ingest requests. See <a href="/node/17941">Fallback / Retry Strategy</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Obtain credentials</h2>

<p>Like most of Brightcove's RESTful APIs, the Dynamic Ingest API requires OAuth access tokens to authorize requests. In order to get access tokens, you first need to obtain client credentials with permissions for kinds of operations you want to request. This quick start makes API requests on a Brightcove Learning Services sample account, so you will not need to obtain credentials here, but you should understand what's happening. The CodePen sends the API request information to a proxy similar to <a href="../../oauth-api/guides/get-token.html#php">this one</a>. The proxy accesses client credentials from a private location and uses them to generate a temporary access token using the <a href="../../oauth-api/index.html">OAuth API</a> and then makes the API request and returns the response data.</p>

<p>To try requests on your own account, get your client credentials and use one of our <a href="../../concepts/api-testing-tools/api-testing-tools.html">API testing tools</a></p>

<ol>
	<li>To obtain your credentials follow the instructions in <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/docs/managing-api-authentication-credentials">Managing API Credentials</a>. This is the recommended way of obtaining your client credentials. Remember that using Dyanamic Ingest requires making one CMS API POST request as well, so in addition to ingest permission, you need at least <code>video/write</code> permissions:

	</figure>

	<p>Use the <a href="//support.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/docs/managing-api-authentication-credentials">Studio Admin Tools</a> to get client credentials. You can also obtain credentials using the OAuth API, following the instructions in one of the guides listed below.</p>
