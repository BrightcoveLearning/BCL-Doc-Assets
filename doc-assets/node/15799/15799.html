<p>Because ATS restrictions do not apply to previous versions of the iOS SDK, it will only affect applications that target the iOS 9 SDK or later. Applications that target earlier versions of the SDK and those already in the App Store will not be affected.</p>

<p>Support for ATS within the Brightcove ecosystem is now available. You have two options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Build your application with ATS enabled</li>
	<li>Use ATS exceptions</li>
</ul>

<p>If you absolutely need to, you can disable ATS requirements, but this option will be going away in the near future. Apple plans to require ATS for all App Store apps.</p>

<p>To learn more, see the <a href="/node/18215">Working with App Transport Security (ATS)</a> document.</p>
