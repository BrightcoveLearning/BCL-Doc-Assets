<p>The Native SDK for tvOS allows you to create video-centric apps for the Apple TV.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Video Cloud customers can play Video Cloud library content</li>
	<li>Brightcove Player customers can play videos with internet accessible URLs</li>
</ul>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is required in your project. This is the current default for Xcode projects.</li>
	<li>The Brightcove Native SDK for tvOS is written to allow you to create custom apps using Obj-C and Swift, but it does not support Apple's Television Markup Language (TVML).</li>
	<li>With the release of iOS 9 and Xcode 7, a new feature called App Transport Security (ATS) was introduced. Learn more about <a href="/node/18215">Working with App Transport Security</a>.</li>
	<li>The Native SDK for tvOS currently does not support player controls. For details about adding your own controls to your app, see the <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/ios-player-samples/tree/master/OUX/BasicOUXtvOSPlayer/objc">Obj-C version of the Basic tvOS player with the Once UX plugin</a> sample.</li>

<!--                <p>At Brightcove, we strive to keep the documentation structured, clean and intuitive. As such, we leverage github READMEs for details on all our plugins and integrations. For your convenience, we've listed and linked to these plugins below.</p>-->

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Supported_versions">Supported versions</h2>

<p>In order to take advantage of the latest technology improvements from Apple, we currently offer support for the following:</p>

<h3>Active support</h3>

<p>Brightcove provides active support for the latest iOS SDK on the following tvOS versions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>tvOS 10</li>
	<li>tvOS 9</li>
</ul>
<!-- <h3>Passive support</h3>
                <p>Brightcove provides passive support for the following tvOS versions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>none</li>
                </ul> -->

<h3>Understanding support levels</h3>

<p>There are two levels of support:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Active</strong>: Brightcove will test and fix bugs on these OS versions.</li>
	<li><strong>Passive</strong>: Brightcove will test on these OS versions, but bug fixes will be handled on a case by case basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, Brightcove provides active support for the versions of the OS that are used by 80% of the user base, and passive support for other versions used by at least 5% of the user base.</p>

<h2 id="Getting_started">Getting started</h2>

<p>Before beginning development with the Player SDK for tvOS, there are a few concepts you should learn about:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Media
	<p>The current version of the Native Player SDK supports playing content from your Video Cloud account through the Playback API, or as remote assets with internet accessible URLs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Analytics
	<p>With the Native Player SDK, Video Cloud customers automatically get robust analytics data reported in Video Cloud.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="//cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>
	<p>The Brightcove Player SDK for iOS and its plugins can be added to your project using the CocoaPods dependency manager. The podspecs for all of the Brightcove Player SDK components are hosted in the <a href="https://github.com/brightcove/BrightcoveSpecs">BrightcoveSpecs repository</a>.</p>

	<p>Be sure to add this repository to your podfiles like this:</p>

	<pre class="line-numbers">
		<code class="language-swift">source 'https://github.com/brightcove/BrightcoveSpecs.git'</code></pre>

	<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">CocoaPods version 1.0 or newer is required.</aside>
	</li>
	<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brightcove-native-player-sdks">SDK developer forum</a>
	<p>Join us in the SDK developer forum where SDK related questions are answered by Brightcove engineers and the community. Search for previously answered questions or post a new one. As a public group, you can gain access by providing your email address.</p>

<h2 id="Integrations">Integrations</h2>

<p>The following table contains links to get plugins integrated with your SDK implementation. The plugins can be downloaded from their respective Github Repos, and each repo contains a detailed README with instructions on how to setup the plugin.</p>

<p>The sample applications demonstrate the basic functionality of each plugin integrated with the SDK. These sample apps are a good way to learn about each plugin, and serve as a reference point when debugging.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">The current release of the Native SDK for iOS includes all components with the same version number. When integrating components, the SDK and component version numbers must match. For example, when using the Once UX plugin component v6.0.2, you must use the Native SDK v6.0.2.</aside>
