  <p>Lead forms can be used to capture viewer information as viewers watch videos and can be used with the following types of experiences:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li class="language-editable">Portal</li>
    <li class="language-editable">Live Event Portal</li>
    <li class="language-editable">Landing Page</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>With Portal, Live Event Portal and some Landing Page experiences, lead forms will be displayed inside the player. Lead forms can be configured to display after a specified number of videos have been viewed or after a predetermined time interval has passed. The following is an example of a lead form displayed inside of a player:</p>
  
  <div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="sample lead form" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node13702-sample-lead-form1.png" /></div>
  
  <p>Landing Page experiences can also be configured to display a lead form on the body of the page, for example:</p>
  
  <div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="sample lead form" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node13702-landing-page-lead-form.png" /></div>
  
  <p>Lead data can be downloaded in comma separated or Excel file formats.</p>
  
  <p>The steps to use a lead form are as follows:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li class="language-editable"><a href="#create">Create a lead form using the Audience module</a></li>
    <li class="language-editable"><a href="#assign">Assign the lead form to an Audience-enabled player</a></li>
    <li class="language-editable"><a href="#configure">Configure an experience to use the lead form</a></li>
    <li class="language-editable"><a href="#export">Export the lead data</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="create">Creating a lead form</h2>
  
  <p>Lead forms are created using the Audience module. For complete steps to creating a lead form including all of the options that are available, see <a href="/node/15860">Creating an Audience Lead Form</a>. To create a lead form, follow these steps:</p>

  <div class="BCL-concept">
  <h2 id="assign">Assigning a lead form to an Audience-enabled player</h2>
  
  <p>Lead forms can only be displayed in Audience-enabled players. An Audience-enabled player is a Brightcove Player that is configured with the Audience plugin. Audience-enabled players record video engagement data that can be viewed inside of the Audience module. To create an Audience-enabled-player, follow these steps:</p>
  
  <ol class="bcls-tasklist">

    <li class="language-editable">Click <strong>Audience Players</strong>.</li>
    <li class="language-editable">Click <strong>Create Player</strong> to create a new Audience-enabled player.
    <p class="BCL-aside language-editable">Note: It is also possible to <a href="/node/16419#existingplayer">add the Audience plugin to an existing player</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="language-editable">Locate your player and use the <strong>Lead Form</strong> dropdown list to select the lead form to display.
    <div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="select lead form" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node13702-select-lead-form.png" /></div>
    </li>
    <li class="language-editable">(Optional) If you are using Audience to track video engagement data, the player should be configured with a data connection using the <strong>Connect To</strong> dropdown list.</li>
  </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div class="BCL-concept">
  <h2 id="configure">Configuring an experience to use a lead form</h2>
  
  <p>After a lead form has been created and assigned to an Audience-enabled player, it can be used in a portal experience. To configure an experience to use a lead form, follow these steps:</p>
