<div class="BCL-concept">
<p>The <strong>Advanced (in-page) embed</strong>&nbsp;code permits you to have the player exist in the the HTML page directly, not in an iframe. This offers the benefits of ease of accessing the player and associated properties and events. By using the non-iframe player, you lose the ease of use of the player as a single, contained unit in social media applications and sharing.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information player-only">Note: If you are a Brightcove Player customer, you will not use the <code>data-video-id</code> attribute to assign a video to your player. You would either assign the video in the <strong>Players</strong> module or using curl.</aside>

<p>To use the <strong>in-page embed</strong> code follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>PLAYERS</strong> module to create a player.</li>
	<li>Go to the <strong>MEDIA</strong> module and publish a video using the newly created player.</li>
	<li>Copy the <strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;embed code. The HTML will be similar to the following:
	<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-html">&lt;video data-video-id="4093372393001"
  data-account="1507807800001"
  data-player="ry3j6rsze"
  data-embed="default"
  data-application-id
  class="video-js"
  controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;script src="//players.brightcove.net/1507807800001/ry3j6rsze_default/index.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>Copy the HTML from the browser and paste into the <code>body</code> of a full HTML page.</li>
	<li>Browse the HTML page to see the player functioning.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>

<p>Numerous attributes are available for the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag to provide additional information about how a player should behave. The table below details available attributes.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">
<p>When using tag attributes that can only be true or false (data type <strong>Boolean</strong>), you simply include the attribute (no equals sign) to turn it on.</p>

<p>RIGHT: <code>controls</code></p>

<p>WRONG: <code>controls="true"</code></p>

<p>In order to use Booleans, the attribute should be disabled by default in the player configuration settings, then it is enabled by including the attribute in the in-page embed code. For instance, if <strong>autoplay</strong> is enabled in the player configuration there is no way to disable that feature in the in-page embed code. This means that if you want to control a Boolean attribute, you want to be sure it is disabled in the player configuration then you can optionally enable it by placing the appropriate attribute in the in-page embed code. Enabling the attribute in the player configuration overrides omitting the attribute in the in-page embed code.</p>

<h2 id="preload_details">preload details</h2>

<p>The preload attribute informs the browser whether or not the video data should begin downloading as soon as the video tag is loaded. The options are <strong>auto</strong>, <strong>metadata</strong>, and <strong>none</strong>. For HLS playback technology the settings mean slightly different things and noted below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>auto</strong> (default): Start loading the video immediately (if the browser agrees). Some mobile devices like iPhones and iPads will not preload the video in order to protect their users' bandwidth. This is why the value is called <strong>auto</strong> and not something more final like <strong>true</strong>.</p>

	<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">For the HLS playback technology, <strong>auto</strong> means the player downloads the m3u8 manifest file and only 1 segment instead of 3-4, as was the case before version 5.3 of Brightcove Player.</aside>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>metadata</strong>: Load only the meta data of the video, which includes information like the duration and dimensions of the video.</p>

	<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">For the HLS playback technology, <strong>metadata</strong> is the same as <strong>auto</strong>.</aside>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>none</strong>: Don't preload any of the video data. This will wait until the user clicks play to begin downloading. Note that on iOS there may be segment downloading even with this setting. See the <a href="/node/18106">Brightcove Player and iOS</a> document for more information.</p>

	<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">For the HLS playback technology, <strong>none</strong> means player will no longer load anything, including the m3u8 manifest, until the user presses play.</aside>
