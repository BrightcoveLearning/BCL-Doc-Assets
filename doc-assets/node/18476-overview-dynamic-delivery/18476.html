<p>Delivering media to different devices — on desktop, mobile, and connected TVs — requires a mix of ever-changing technologies: audio and video codecs, various types of packaging for streaming video, and various content protection schemes to protect content from being copied. Without the use of Dynamic Delivery, cross-platform streaming often requires storing the same content multiple times to support delivery to all your target platforms. Dynamic Delivery allows Brightcove customers to deliver media to a range of devices without the cost and operational overhead of re-packaging and storing content multiple times for every supported device and use-case. Dynamic Delivery creates the optimal content package just-in-time for delivery and streaming to all supported devices and use-cases, which also future-proofs your delivery architecture as technology and your audience evolves.</p>

<p>With Dynamic Delivery, customers provide a single high-quality (mezzanine) video file. During the ingest process, we create several quality levels of this file suited to a range of different screen sizes and network conditions. When a viewer presses play, Video Cloud uses information about the requesting device to determine the type of streaming technology expected — for example, the type of stream packaging (HLS vs. DASH), the DRM required (e.g. Widevine, Fairplay, Playready), and ancillary content such as closed captions or alternate audio tracks. Dynamic Delivery then uses this information to deliver the appropriate content package (i.e. type of stream) for the requesting device in real-time.</p>

    <li>When a source file is uploaded, the transcoding process will use the selected ingest profile to determine the set of renditions to create.</li>
    <li>Renditions are stored as a set of contiguous, fragmented MP4 files of various bit rates and resolutions that are agnostic of any specific delivery format.</li>
    <li>When a request is made for a video, the Dynamic Delivery process does Just-in-Time or JIT packaging, which means it will dynamically package content into the appropriate format based specified requirements. This packaging will take into consideration the specific delivery format needed, audio and caption tracks needed, as well as any encryption/DRM needed.</li>
    <li>When the playback device uses the manifest returned by the Playback API to request media to play, we perform just-in-time packaging on the fragmented MP4 files to provide the appropriate segment format, duration and encryption. These fragments are cached on a CDN so that video delivery is still highly performant.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Dynamic Delivery process was designed to be a fully managed, cloud-based service.  All the components run on cloud infrastructure in multiple regions to insure high availability, redundancy and scalability. </p>

  <h2 id="migration_process">Migration process</h2>
  <p>As of Tuesday, October 17, 2017, all new Video Cloud accounts that are created are configured to use Dynamic Delivery by default. This includes trial accounts, accounts for new publishers, and new sub-accounts for existing publishers. With this change, all new publishers and trial customers will automatically  benefit from all the features of Dynamic Delivery.</p>
  <p>For existing customers, the migration is a two step process. First, new uploads are transitioned to utilize Dynamic Delivery (day forward migration) and second, existing content is migrated from the legacy delivery platform to Dynamic Delivery (back catalog migration.)</p>
  <h3>Day forward migration</h3>
  <p>The first step to moving to Dynamic Delivery is transitioning new uploads to utilize Dynamic Delivery. Enabling your account for Dynamic Delivery is a simple task that can be completed by Customer Support. There is no danger in enabling an existing Video Cloud account for Dynamic Delivery as it does not modify any existing content. Only content explicitly ingested to Dynamic Delivery will utilize the new system.</p>
  <p>From a workflow perspective, a couple of things will appear differently inside Video Cloud Studio. First, when uploading videos using the Upload module, you will now see Dynamic Delivery ingestion profiles in your account.</p>

<p>The Media module will also display a green cloud icon (<img src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18476-overview-dynamic-delivery/green-cloud-icon.png" alt="green cloud icon">) next to video titles ingested using a Dynamic Delivery profile. Videos ingested using a legacy ingest profile will display a gray icon (<img src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18476-overview-dynamic-delivery/gray-cloud-icon.png" alt="gray cloud icon">).</p>

<p>How can I tell if my account is already enabled for Dynamic Delivery?</p>

<p>The easiest way to tell if your account is enabled for Dynamic Delivery is to navigate to the Upload Module and open the “Ingest Profile” dropdown. If you see the “Dynamic Delivery” subheading that means your account is enabled for Dynamic Delivery.</p>
