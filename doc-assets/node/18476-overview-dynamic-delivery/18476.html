<p>Delivering media to different devices — on desktop, mobile, and connected TVs — requires a mix of ever-changing technologies: audio and video codecs, various types of packaging for streaming video, and various content protection schemes to protect content from being copied. Without the use of Dynamic Delivery, cross-platform streaming often requires storing the same content multiple times to support delivery to all your target platforms. Dynamic Delivery allows Brightcove customers to deliver media to a range of devices without the cost and operational overhead of re-packaging and storing content multiple times for every supported device and use-case. Dynamic Delivery creates the optimal content package just-in-time for delivery and streaming to all supported devices and use-cases, which also future-proofs your delivery architecture as technology and your audience evolves.</p>

<p>With Dynamic Delivery, customers provide a single high-quality (mezzanine) video file. During the ingest process, we create several quality levels of this file suited to a range of different screen sizes and network conditions. When a viewer presses play, Video Cloud uses information about the requesting device to determine the type of streaming technology expected — for example, the type of stream packaging (HLS vs. DASH), the DRM required (e.g. Widevine, Fairplay, Playready), and ancillary content such as closed captions or alternate audio tracks. Dynamic Delivery then uses this information to deliver the appropriate content package (i.e. type of stream) for the requesting device in real-time.</p>

<p>How can I tell if my account is already enabled for Dynamic Delivery?</p>

<p>The easiest way to tell if your account is enabled for Dynamic Delivery is to navigate to the Upload Module and open the “Ingest Profile” dropdown. If you see the “Dynamic Delivery” subheading that means your account is enabled for Dynamic Delivery.</p>
