<p>As of December 13th 2015, Brightcove will no longer provide bug fixes or improvements specific to the VisualOn integration. Applications with existing HLS Player integrations will continue to work as they have, however, we strongly encourage customers to begin testing with the <a href="/node/18212">new HLS solution</a> and transition as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="data" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Questions</h2>

<p>We understand that this is a technical topic and are happy to answer any questions concerning the transition. Please reach out to us through the <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brightcove-native-player-sdks">SDK Developer Forums</a> for technical questions, or to your account manager for concerns.</p>
