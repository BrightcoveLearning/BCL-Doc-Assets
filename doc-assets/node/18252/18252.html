    <h2>Using the BrightcovePlayer class
    </h2>
    <p>The
      <code>BrightcovePlayer
      </code> class is a basic Activity, which wraps a
      <code>BrightcoveExoPlayerVideoView
      </code> and sets up an
      <code>EventLogger
      </code> and default
      <code>MediaController
      </code>. It implements basic lifecycle management and full screen logic. It is meant to be subclassed.
    </p>
    <p>At a minimum the
      <code>onCreate()
      </code> method should be overridden with logic to wire up the
      <code>BrightcoveExoPlayerVideoView
      </code> variable to the <strong>layout.xml</strong> file. For example:
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-java">brightcoveVideoView = (BrightcoveExoPlayerVideoView) findViewById(R.id.brightcove_video_view);
</code>
</pre>
    <p>If you want to combine the Brightcove Player with other design elements in your layout, you may choose to use the
      <code>BrightcovePlayerFragment
      </code>. This is useful when designing for a tablet or larger screen, which has more room to combine UI components.

    <h2>Lifecycle management
    </h2>
    <p>It is best practice to start with either the
      <code>BrightcovePlayer
      </code> activity or the
      <code>BrightcovePlayerFragment
      </code>, since these provide default lifecycle management implementation, including the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>When a user pauses the app, the class keeps track of where they stopped.</li>
      <li>When your app comes back from the background, the class remembers whether the video was playing or not, and restart playback where it left off.</li>
      <li>If your app is killed due to memory issues, the class will seek to time in video to where it was.</li>
      <li>An event logger is setup, which logs all events to logcat. This can be helpful for debugging.</li>
      <li>The class dispatches events to communicate with plugins.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Now that you have an activity, you are ready to choose a video view, as detailed in the next document.
