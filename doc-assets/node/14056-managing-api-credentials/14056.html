<p>When you use the Video Cloud APIs, your method calls will require access tokens unless you enable basic authentication in the Player Service Settings. For more information on enabling basic authentication, see <a href="/node/14055">Managing Account Settings</a>.</p>

<h2 id="creating">Creating client registrations</h2>

<p>The API Authentication page is used to create new client registrations. When creating registrations, you can select the service and the roles that will be enabled with the registration.</p>

<h3>Multiple accounts</h3>

<p>If you currently have multiple Video Cloud accounts set up as content sources in DFP, you have two options:</p>

<ol>
	<li>You can create a unique Client ID and Client secret for each Video Cloud account thatâ€™s set up as a content source in DFP. For example, if you have 10 Video Cloud accounts, you'd have 10 applications named DFP in your API Authentication settings in Video Cloud.</li>
	<li>You can can create a single Client ID and Client secret for all Video Cloud accounts that have been set up as content sources in DFP. For example, if you have 10 Video Cloud accounts, you'd have 1 application named DFP in your API Authentication settings in Video Cloud.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of whether you chose option #1 or #2, for each content source that you set up in DFP, you need to provide a unique Account ID. So, you are not reducing the number of content sources that are currently set up in DFP; you're just replacing the read token with the Client ID and Client secret, which can either be the same across content sources or unique for each.</p>

<p>Option #1 takes more time upfront. However, if the Client ID and Client secret are the same across all content sources (as with option #2), it will be a burden to add a new content source because you will need to generate a new Client ID and Client secret and update all of content sources in DFP. So, Brightcove recommends option #1.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<p>To create a new client registration for your account:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Click the <strong>ADMIN</strong> link in the Studio header.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>API Authentication</strong> link. The API Authentication page will open displaying your current client registrations.

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Only the client registrations for the account you are logged into will display.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Register New Application</strong>.</li>
	<li>Enter a <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Short Description</strong> for the client registration.</li>
	<li>Select one or more of your accounts for authorization. You can select multiple accounts and click <strong>&gt;</strong> to add them or click <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> to add all accounts. Click <strong>&lt;</strong> to remove an account or <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> to remove all accounts.</li>
	<li>Select the API(s) and permission(s) to enable for this registration.

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Selecting a large number of accounts and APIs may cause the HTTP header size to become large and invalid. The maximum header size that our server accepts is 8K, which means that you must select 30 accounts or less to apply the credentials to. For security reasons, we recommend that you limit the scope of permissions for a set of credentials to the smallest set of accounts and operations necessary.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
	<li>A <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client secret</strong> will be returned.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node14056-client-id-secret.png" /></div>

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Copy the client secret and store it in a secure location as the client secret <strong>will not</strong> be displayed again.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
