<ul>
  <li id="legacy_studio_eol">On May 31, all remaining support for the legacy Studio will be terminated.</li>
  <li id="changes_ie_support">As of July 1, 2018, the Brightcove Player will no longer support all versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer prior to version 11, including IE 8, 9, and 10. Versions of the Brightcove Player released before July 1 may continue to work on IE 10 and below but we will no longer test on any of those browsers or consider bug fixes specific to those versions.</li>
  <li id="brightcove_player_versions_support">As of July 1, 2018, we will no longer support version 5.9 of the Brightcove Player (and previous versions). Customers who want to make any changes to their players after that time will have to upgrade to a later version. If no changes or support are desired, however, version 5.9 and below will continue to be hosted and will continue to work unmodified.</li>

<h2 id="past_service_changes">Past Service Changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li id="smart_player_eol">On April 1, 2018, all support for the Smart Player was terminated.</li>

  <li id="mapi_read_methods">On December 31, 2017, the <strong>read</strong> methods of the <strong>Media API</strong> were fully retired.</li>

  <li id="mapi_write_methods">On June 30, 2017, Brightcove retired the <strong>write methods</strong> exposed by the <strong>Media API</strong> (e.g., <code>update_video</code>).</li>

  <li id="batch_provisioning">On June 30, 2017, Brightcove ceased supporting the <strong>FTP Batch Provisioning System</strong> and the <strong>content ingest methods of the Media API</strong>. The <strong>Aspera upload method</strong> ceased to be supported at the same time.</li>

  <li id="ugcmethods"><strong>Deprecation of Media API read methods find_videos_by_user_id and find_videos_by_campaign_id. </strong>Effective January 31, 2012,<strong> </strong>Brightcove deprecated support for the Video Cloud Media API read methods <code>find_videos_by_user_id </code>and <code>find_videos_by_campaign_id</code>. These methods were used together with the old Consumer Generated Media module in Brightcove 2. For current best practices for managing user-generated content, see <a href="http://node/3188">User Generated Content</a>.</li>

  <li><strong>Deprecation of Media API read methods find_videos_by_text and find_videos_by_tag. </strong>Effective December 31, 2011,<strong> </strong>Brightcove deprecated support for the Video Cloud Media API read methods <code>find_videos_by_tag</code> and <code>find_videos_by_text</code>. We encourage you to use the <code>search_videos</code> method for video searches rather than using the <code>find_video</code> read methods. The <code>search_videos</code> method offers more flexible search and sorting options than the <code>find_video</code> methods, and is especially more flexible than the <code>find_videos_by_text</code> and <code>find_videos_by_tags</code> methods.</li>

  <li><strong>Flash Player Support. </strong>Effective May 15, 2011, Brightcove no longer supports Flash Player 9 for using the Video Cloud Studio or Video Cloud players. Video Cloud Studio users should upgrade to Flash Player 10. <a href="http://blog.brightcove.com/en/2011/04/end-support-flash-player-9">Read more about why we're doing this and what it means to you</a>.</li>

  <li><strong>Content type for Media API responses</strong>. The content type for responses returned by the Video Cloud Media API is <code>application/json</code> and not <code>text/html</code>. Using the <code>application/json</code> content type should provide superior security. The change in content type should not affect how any JSON returned in a Media API method is parsed.</li>

  <li><strong>Error returned by Media API search_videos method for invalid sort_by arguments.</strong> If you call the <code>search_videos</code> method in the Media API with an invalid <code>sort_by</code> argument, the error returned currently includes the text of the invalid argument. Calls that include illegal characters (such as &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, \, %, or +) in the <code>sort_by</code> argument will return an error message with the illegal characters escaped.</li>
