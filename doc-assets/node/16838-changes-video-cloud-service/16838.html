<h2>Coming Service Changes</h2>

<h3><strong>Video Cloud API Service Changes and EOL Deprecation Notice</strong></h3>

<p>Brightcove has been hard at work delivering the next generation of online video technologies. Over the past 2 years, we introduced the Dynamic Ingest, CMS and Playback APIs to replace older integration methods with faster, better and more reliable technology.</p>

<p>With these newer APIs in place, we are beginning the process of <em><strong>deprecating the legacy Media API and FTP Batch XML systems</strong></em>. This document summarizes the timeline for this process and provides links to help you manage the transition. If you are currently using legacy Media API and/or FTP Batch XML, this notice should help you form a plan for migrating away from these legacy systems. If you are not using any of these APIs, no action is required.</p>

<h3><strong>Ingesting Content and Synchronizing Metadata with a CMS</strong></h3>

<p>On June 30, 2017, Brightcove will cease supporting the FTP Batch Provisioning System and the content ingest methods of the Media API. The Aspera upload method will cease to be supported at the same time. To add new content or to re-transcode existing titles in a Video Cloud account after June 30, 2017, all customers will need to use Dynamic Ingest. Introduced over 18 months ago, the Dynamic Ingest API supports all of the same formats and workflows as our legacy ingestion APIs and provides greater performance and scalability.</p>

<p>Also on June 30, 2017, we will be retiring the write methods exposed by the Media API (e.g., update_video) and all customers and partners will need to migrate their applications to the CMS API prior to June 30, 2017. The CMS API has been designed to improve the performance and flexibility of Video Cloud integrations and works with all of the latest features of the new Brightcove Player and Video Cloud Studio.</p>

<p>All of the <a href="http://go.brightcove.com/cms">CMS connectors managed by Brightcove</a> have been updated to use Dynamic Ingest, and content ingested via this method can be published with the new Brightcove Player or the legacy Smart Player. <a href="/node/17955">This migration guide</a> details how custom integrations can be migrated to the new APIs.</p>

<h3><strong>Displaying Metadata on Client-Facing Sites/Applications</strong></h3>

<p>On December 31, 2017, the “read” methods of the Media API will be fully retired. Customers that have built client-facing applications (e.g., web pages or mobile apps) that depend on the Media API must migrate to the Playback API before December 31, 2017. The Playback API has been designed for high-volume read operations and provides the functionality and scalability required for large scale apps.</p>

<p>The iOS and Android SDKs have already been updated to use the Playback API. To support web site integration, in the coming quarters Brightcove plans to enhance the Playback API to support search queries, related videos and additional functionality commonly requested by customers.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>To ensure that your sites and applications continue to operate smoothly, we strongly recommend you evaluate your current usage of these APIs and beginning planning migration to the newer APIs if necessary. During the transition periods described above, we will provide reminders about the timeline and additional information, tools and resources on moving to the new APIs. For more information, please consult the <a href="/node/17955">media management</a> documentation. You can also contact your account manager for more details.</p>

<h2>Past Service Changes</h2>

<p><strong><a id="ugcmethods" name="ugcmethods" href=""></a>Deprecation of Media API read methods find_videos_by_user_id and find_videos_by_campaign_id. </strong>Effective January 31, 2012,<strong> </strong>Brightcove deprecated support for the Video Cloud Media API read methods <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_user_id </span>and <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_campaign_id</span>. These methods were used together with the old Consumer Generated Media module in Brightcove 2. For current best practices for managing user-generated content, see <a href="http://node/3188">User Generated Content</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Deprecation of Media API read methods find_videos_by_text and find_videos_by_tag. </strong>Effective December 31, 2011,<strong> </strong>Brightcove deprecated support for the Video Cloud Media API read methods <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_tag</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_text</span>. We encourage you to use the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">search_videos</span> method for video searches rather than using the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_video</span> read methods. The <span style="font-family: Courier New;">search_videos</span> method offers more flexible search and sorting options than the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_video</span> methods, and is especially more flexible than the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_text</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos_by_tags</span> methods.</p>

<p><strong>Flash Player Support. </strong>Effective May 15, 2011, Brightcove no longer supports Flash Player 9 for using the Video Cloud Studio or Video Cloud&nbsp; players. Video Cloud Studio users should upgrade to Flash Player 10. <a href="http://blog.brightcove.com/en/2011/04/end-support-flash-player-9">Read more about why we're doing this and what it means to you</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Content type for Media API responses</strong>. The content type for responses returned by the Video Cloud Media API is <span style="font-family: Courier New;">application/json</span> and not <span style="font-family: Courier New;">text/html</span>. Using the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">application/json</span> content type should provide superior security. The change in content type should not affect how any JSON returned in a Media API method is parsed.</p>

<p><strong>Error returned by Media API search_videos method for invalid sort_by arguments.</strong> If you call the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">search_videos</span> method in the Media API with an invalid <span style="font-family: Courier New;">sort_by</span> argument, the error returned currently includes the text of the invalid argument. Calls that include illegal characters (such as &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, \, %, or +) in the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">sort_by</span> argument will return an error message with the illegal characters escaped.</p>
