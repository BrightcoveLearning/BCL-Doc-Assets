<h2>DRM</h2>

<p>DRM (Digital Rights Management) protects your video content by encrypting the video data and unlocking it based on license policies. When the video content is loaded into a Brightcove player, the player calls back to a licensing server and obtains permission to play the video. This transaction is transparent to viewers. See the <a href="/node/18436">Overview: Digital Rights Management (DRM) in Video Cloud</a> document for more information.</p>

<h2 id="ttl">TTL (token authentication)</h2>

<p>On a video request <span class="video-cloud-only">Video Cloud</span><span class="player-only">Studio</span> generates TTL values and Brightcove Player then utilizes those values. For further details see the <a href="/node/549">Content Delivery Options</a> document.</p>

<section id="domainrestrictions" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Domain restrictions</h2>

<p>Domain restrictions can be set on players to limit the domains where players can be used. If the player publishing code is copied and used on another site, domain restrictions would prevent the player from loading any videos. Publishers must use the in-page embed code to actually get playback working on those domains that have been whitelisted. Publishers cannot use the iframe embed code on a whitelisted domain (or any other domain) and expect playback to function properly.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/node/15616">Configuring Player Availability</a> document for instructions on how to domain restrict your player and the <a href="/node/18052">Domain Restrictions Messaging</a> document on how to deal with domain restriction errors in Brightcove Player.</p>

<section id="iprestrictions" class="section video-cloud-only">
<h2>IP restrictions</h2>

<p>With IP restrictions, you can configure players to allow whitelisted IP addresses outside the U.S. to access your Video Cloud content. Please contact Customer Support for assistance. For players used outside of North America with IP restrictions, be sure to check out the information in the <a href="/node/8065">Restricting Video Playback Using IP Address</a> to prevent issues that may arise.</p>
