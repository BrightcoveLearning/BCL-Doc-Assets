<h2 id="domains">Configuring domain restrictions</h2>

<p>Domain restrictions can be set on players to limit the domains where players can be used. If the player publishing code is copied and used on another site, domain restrictions would prevent the player from loading any videos. Publishers must use the in-page embed code to actually get playback working on those domains that have been whitelisted. Publishers cannot use the iframe embed code on a whitelisted domain (or any other domain) and expect playback to function properly.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>While domain restrictions can help prevent unauthorized distribution of your content, customers seeking maximum content security should look at DRM solutions instead. See <a href="/node/18436">Digital Rights Management (DRM) in Video Cloud</a> for more information.</p></li>
    <li><p>For viewers using Internet Explorer, the domain restriction feature requires version 10 or newer. Viewers using Internet Explorer &lt; 10 will not get playback at all.</p></li>

<p>To configure a domain restriction for a player, follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Enter one or more complete domain URLs (such as http://www.brightcove.com or https://www.brightcove.com) to restrict your player's availability to these particular domains. Be sure to include either http:// or https://.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Complete URLs must be provided. Wildcards in URLs are not supported. URLs should not end with a /.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Only domains, not specific paths, are supported. For example, you can add <code>https://www.brightcove.com</code>, but <strong>not</strong> <code>https://www.brightcove.com<span class="bcls-highlight">/documentation</span></code></p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: If using domain restrictions, you configure domain restrictions for all players in your account. If you don't, you're vulnerable to someone taking the policy key from an unprotected player and using it to play any video.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: While there is no limit on the number of domains that can be added in Studio, there is a limit on the length of the URL for the API request - included in that URL will be the comma-delimited list of domains. Therefore there is a limit on the number of domains that can be specified, but the number will depend on how long the domain names are.</p>

	<li>Some publishers have requested the ability to geo filter players to US military bases as well as the US. To support this, there is a <strong>US Military</strong> option. While there is no 100% reliable way to identify a military base, when an IP that resolves to a .mil domain is encountered, and is not in the US, it will be identified as coming from a US military base rather than its actual country of origin. .mil addresses that are in the US will still be identified as "us".</li>

	<li>The domain restriction feature requires IE version 10 or newer. Viewers using Internet Explorer &lt; 10 will not get playback at all.</li>

<p>Domain restrictions are implemented by the account's policy key. If an account has any non-domain restricted policy keys generated for it, those keys can be used to watch any content in the account. Therefore, all policy keys for an account must be domain restricted.</p>
