<div class="BCL-concept">
<p>The player availability properties can be used to restrict a player to particular countries, or block a player from particular countries. Domain restrictions can be set on a player to limit the domains where the player can be used.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The player availability properties are only available to Enterprise and Professional accounts.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: IP address can also be used to limit playback For information, see <a href="/node/8065">Restricting Video Playback Using IP Address</a>.</p>

<p>To view and edit the availability properties for a player, open the Players module, click on a player name and locate the <strong>Availability</strong> section.</p>

<p>To edit the Availability properties, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button or double-click in the section. Player availability can be configured based upon:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#geofilter">Geo filtering</a></li>
	<li><a href="#domains">Domain restrictions</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Any changes made to a player may take up to 5 minutes to appear in published players.</p>

<h2 id="geofilter">Configuring geo filtering</h2>

<p>Geo filtering can be used to control which countries can, and cannot, use a player.</p>

<div class="BCL-aside">Notes:
<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>The ability to use player geo filtering is a feature available to Enterprise and Professional accounts for an additional fee. Contact Brightcove if you would like to upgrade your account to include geo filtering.</li>
	<li>Geo filtering can also be <a href="/node/15476">applied to individual videos</a>. Video Cloud will apply both player and video geo-filtering policies - if a country is excluded by either, the video will not be available there.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>To set the geo filtering properties for a player:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Select <strong>Allow viewing from the following countries</strong> or <strong>Prevent viewing from the following countries</strong>.

	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node15616-geo-settings.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li>Enter the appropriate country names. As you type, the country list will be filtered.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node15616-geofilter-country.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="domains">Configuring domain restrictions</h2>

<p>Domain restrictions can be set on players to limit the domains where players can be used. If the player publishing code is copied and used on another site, domain restrictions would prevent the player from loading any videos. Publishers must use the in-page embed code to actually get playback working on those domains that have been whitelisted. Publishers cannot use the iframe embed code on a whitelisted domain (or any other domain) and expect playback to function properly.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: While domain restrictions can help prevent unauthorized distribution of your content, customers seeking maximum content security should look at DRM solutions instead. See <a href="/node/6302">Content Protection and Digital Rights Management</a> for more information.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: For viewers using Internet Explorer, the domain restriction feature requires version 10 or newer. Viewers using Internet Explorer &lt; 10 will not get playback at all.</p>

<p>To configure a domain restriction for a player, follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Enter one or more complete URLs (such as http://www.brightcove.com or https://www.brightcove.com) to restrict your player's availability to these particular domains. Be sure to include either http:// or https://.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node15616-domains.png" /></div>

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Complete URLs must be provided. Wildcards in URLs are not supported. URLs should not end with a /.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Domain restrictions are implemented by the account's policy key. If an account has any non-domain restricted policy keys generated for it, those keys can be used to watch any content in the account. Therefore, all policy keys for an account must be domain restricted.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: While there is no limit on the number of domains that can be added in Studio, there is a limit on the length of the URL for the API request - included in that URL will be the comma-delimited list of domains. Therefore there is a limit on the number of domains that can be specified, but the number will depend on how long the domain names are.</p>
