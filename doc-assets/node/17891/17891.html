<h2>Supported Encoders</h2>

<p>Zencoder accepts RTMP input and has been tested with several streaming clients for creating your source video stream.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.xsplit.com/">XSplit</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://obsproject.com/">OBS</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Other encoders may work but have not been tested yet. We will expand this list as we are able to test more.</p>
</section>

<section id="Supported_CDNs" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Supported CDNs</h2>

<p>Zencoder can stream generated live outputs to multiple streaming media servers via RTMP and HLS.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Akamai</li>
	<li>Edgecast</li>
	<li>Limelight</li>
	<li>Flash Media Server</li>
	<li>Wowza</li>
	<li>YouTube</li>
	<li>Amazon CloudFront (HLS)</li>
	<li>Fastly</li>
</ul>

<p>Other CDNs and servers may work but have not been tested yet. We will expand this list as we are able to test more.</p>
</section>

<section id="Supported_Formats" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Supported Formats</h2>

<h3 id="input">Input</h3>

<p>For best results, use H.264 and AAC codecs in your RTMP stream. We also support VP6 and MP3, but quality may not be as high when using these codecs. Sending Zencoder the highest quality stream that your upstream connection supports will improve the quality of the streams generated.</p>

<h3 id="output">Output</h3>

<p>Live output videos can be published to an RTMP server or uploaded as HLS segments. Regular, non-live files can also be generated when the input stream has ended.</p>
</section>

<section id="Geographic_Considerations" class="bcls-section">
<h3>Geographic Considerations</h3>

<p>The farther data needs to go, the greater the latency and delay in playback. To reduce latency make sure to use servers in the <a href="/node/17878#region">region</a> closest to the streaming source.</p>

<p>When streaming to Akamai via RTMP the endpoint should be close to the Zencoder transcoding server. <a href="http://app.zencoder.com/contact">Contact support</a> for assistance setting this up.</p>

<h3>The Parts of an API Request</h3>

<h4>Job Creation and Response</h4>

<p>To create a Live Streaming job set <code>live_stream</code> to true and specify at least one output with <code>URL</code> to a compatible host.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "live_stream": true,
    "outputs": [
    {
        "label": "rtmp_300",
        "size": "480x270",
        "video_bitrate": 300,
        "url": "rtmp://user:pass@server.akamaientrypoint.net/EntryPoint/eventname_01_300@63239"
    }
    ]
}</code></pre>

<p>When a Live Streaming job is created, the response to the API request will contain a URL and stream name. Publish your RTMP stream to this URL and Zencoder will begin transcoding to the requested output streams, as explained in the rest of this guide.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "stream_url":"rtmp://live0.us-va.zencoder.io:1935/live",
    "stream_name":"8f4dc774cfd3ed79f27f65c0c43ee5cf",
    "id":123456,
    "outputs":[...]
}</code></pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<h4 id="rtmp-output">RTMP Outputs</h4>

<p>For RTMP outputs, simply specifying an RTMP output URL is enough to publish the stream to your server. This will create an output with the default <a href="/node/17879#quality">quality</a> of 3, which determines the bitrate to use to create a good quality video based on the input. Since the bitrate generated with quality can vary, it is recommended to specify a <a href="/node/17879#video-bitrate">video bitrate</a> to target bitrates for the devices and users who will be watching the stream.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "live_stream": true,
    "outputs": [
    {
        "video_bitrate": 1200,
        "url": "rtmp://user:pass@server.akamaientrypoint.net/EntryPoint/live_01_300@63239"
    }
    ]
}</code></pre>

<p>The format of the ouput file in the URL must match the format in the example above: <code>live_01_300</code>, where <code>live</code> is the event name, <code>01</code> is the angle, and <code>300</code> is the bitrate. Each is separated by an underscore. Bitrate is not required.</p>

<p>By default the stream will use the H.264 and AAC codecs for <a href="/node/17856#video-codec">video</a> and <a href="/node/17856#audio-codec">audio</a>. MP3 can also be used for audio.</p>

<p>For RTMP servers requiring authentication, the username and password can be provided via the URL, like <code>rtmp://username:password@outputserver:1935/app/streamname/live_01_300@63239</code>. This can be used to publish to Wowza or FMS servers, as well as many CDNs, such as Akamai.</p>

<p>We will simultaneously publish to a <a href="/node/17852#secondary-url">secondary_url</a> if specified. When a primary and backup url are provided by the CDN (such as Akamai), <code>secondary_url</code> should always be set to the backup. This will provide redundancy in case there are issues with the primary stream.</p>
<a name="hls-output"></a>

<h4>HLS Outputs</h4>

<p>HLS outputs are created similarly to regular <a href="http-live-streaming.html">HTTP Live Streaming</a> outputs, with the addition of the <a href="/node/17878#live-stream">live_stream</a> flag. As with RTMP outputs, specifying a <a href="/node/17879#video-bitrate">video bitrate</a> to target bitrates for the devices and users who will be watching the stream is recommended.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "audio_bitrate": 56,
    "audio_sample_rate": 22050,
    "url": "http://post.example.akamaihd.net/PATH/TO/eventname_01_640.m3u8",
    "decoder_bitrate_cap": 900,
    "decoder_buffer_size": 2400,
    "max_frame_rate": 30,
    "public": 1,
    "type": "segmented",
    "video_bitrate": 600,
    "width": 400,
    "format": "ts",
    "live_stream": true
}</code></pre>

<p>Live HLS outputs can be uploaded to any compatible server supported by Zencoder, including S3 and FTP. They can also be transferred to Akamai for HLS Live Delivery via HTTP POST, using an output URL like <code>http://example.akamaihd.net/12355/1234567890/eventname_ios_300.m3u8</code>.</p>

<h4 id="file-outputs">File Outputs</h4>

<p>Output videos in any other <a href="/node/17856#format">format</a> or using any other <a href="/node/17856#video-codec">codecs</a> will be transcoded and uploaded after the input stream has completed.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "label":"archive",
    "url":"s3://example-bucket/eventname_archive.mp4"
}</code></pre>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Setting <a href="/node/17878#live-stream">live_stream</a> with unsupported formats (non-HLS) will cause those outputs to fail.</p>
</aside>

<h3 id="full-request">Full Request</h3>

<p>A full request can create RTMP and HLS outputs, plus an HLS playlist to tell players the available streams for different bandwidths.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "live_stream": true,

<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>S3 Permissions</h3>

<p>When creating HLS outputs on Amazon S3, you must set permissions in your API request to deal with the way AWS makes the file accessible. Not doing this can lead to delays in permissions being applied, and cause issues during playback. Add the settings below to any HLS outputs to ensure that permissions are set correctly.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Due to S3's eventual consistency approach to redundancy, files uploaded there are not always immediately available. This could cause issues with live HLS playback on S3.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">"headers": {
    "x-amz-acl": "public-read"
},
"access_control": [
    {
        "permission": "FULL_CONTROL",
        "grantee": "aws@zencoder.com"
    },
    {
        "permission": "READ",
        "grantee": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers"
    }
]</code></pre>

<h3>Akamai &amp; HLS Playlists</h3>

<p>For the master playlist Akamai expects the filename will be index.m3u8, master.m3u8, or playlist.m3u8. If it is not you may get 404 responses when trying to access the playlist. This can be overridden in your Akamai configuration. See <a href="https://control.akamai.com/portal/kb/kbSearchDetails.jsf?articleId=6027">Akamai's documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Waiting Jobs Limit</h4>

<p>We have a defult limit of 5 waiting streams per account. If you reach this limit, you will need to cancel or start streaming to one of the waiting streams in order to create a new live job. If you need this limit increased, please contact <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/en/contact/create">support</a>.</p>
