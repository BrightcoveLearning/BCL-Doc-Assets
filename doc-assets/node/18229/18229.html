<p>If you use the Brightcove player and the <code>Catalog</code> class included in the SDK to retrieve and play videos, your app will be registered with Brightcove automatically. Also, analytics data will be collected and will appear in your Video Cloud Analytics.</p>

<p>If you override the <code>BCOVVideo</code> class or do not use the Brightcove player and catalog, you need to send your Video Cloud Publisher ID to Video Cloud Analytics. You can do this by setting the analytics <code>account</code> value. This also allows you to view data for this app in Video Cloud Analytics.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-swift">static NSString * const kPublisherID = @"&lt;insert valid accountId&gt;"; // for analytics

    _playbackController.analytics.account = kPublisherID;</code></pre>
