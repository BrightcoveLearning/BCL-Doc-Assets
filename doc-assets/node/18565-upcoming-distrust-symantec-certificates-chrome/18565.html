<p>As outlined in a <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/09/chromes-plan-to-distrust-symantec.html">blog post from Google</a>, starting with Chrome 66, Chrome will remove trust in Symantec-issued certificates issued prior to June 1, 2016.</p>

<p>When viewing pages with a <code>players.brightcove.net</code> domain, you may see the following message displayed in the console:</p>
<code>The SSL certificate used to load resources from https://players.brightcove.net will be distrusted in M70. Once distrusted, users will be prevented from loading these resources. See https://g.co/chrome/symantecpkicerts for more information.</code>


<p class="BCL-aside">Smart Players will also trigger this error when accessing <code>https://sadmin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js</code></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brightcove is aware of this issue and is actively working on it. The Brightcove certificate expires on May 4, 2018 and the existing certificate will be replaced by that date. The trust in the Symantec-issued certificates won't be removed until October 2018. This issue will not impact playback on your sites and will not cause any service disruptions or performance issues for you. If you do happen to encounter issues you may suspect may be caused by this, please contact Brightcove Support.</p>
