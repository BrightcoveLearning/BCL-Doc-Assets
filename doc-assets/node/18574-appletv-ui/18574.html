  <p>When you build Apple TV apps using the Brightcove Native SDK for tvOS, you will get a set of playback controls to allow users to scrub through video content, change the view size, get video information, and manage captions and audio settings.</p>

  <p>
    The controls provided by the Brightcove Native SDK for tvOS include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Progress bar with current time and end time
    </li>
    <li>
      Top menu for video info, captions and audio
    </li>
    <li>
      Ability to add your own custom menu buttons and functionality
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The controls and gestures used will be familiar to users, since they are similar to those found in the AVKit interface.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Brightcove Server-Side Ad Insertion (SSAI), users will see a custom look during ad playback.
  </p>
  <p>
    For details about using the Native SDK, see the <a href="/node/18255">Overview for the Brightcove Player SDK for tvOS</a> document.

The playback controls are manipulated using gestures and button presses on the Apple TV Remote. Below are some of the commands and actions you can use with your app. For details, see the following:

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Progress bar</h3>
<p>
A single tap on the Apple Siri Remote track pad will show/hide the progess progress bar. When playback is paused, panning left and right will scrub backward and forward through your video.
</p>
<p>
The user can click and hold, and then pan left or right to fast forward or reverse through a video.
</p>
<p>
While the video is playing, the user can double click on the left quarter of the Siri remote track pad to jump back 10 seconds or double click on the right quarter of the track pad to jump forward 10 seconds.
</p>

<h3>Video view size</h3>
<p>
A double tap on the Apple Siri Remote track pad will cycle through 3 standard video view sizes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Full screen with aspect ratio respected (video may be cropped)
</li>
<li>
Letterboxing to respect aspect ratio (full video displayed)
</li>
<li>
View stretched to fit full screen (aspect ratio ignored)
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tab bar</h3>
<p>
Swiping down on the Apple TV Remote track pad will display the top menu and hide the progress view. Once visible, swiping up will hide the top menu.
</p>
<p>
The top menu has the following default items:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Info
</li>
<li>
Subtitles
</li>
<li>
Audio
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can modify the text labels associated with each top menu item, or you can create your own custom top menu items.
</p>

<h4>Info</h4>
<p>
Selecting the Info top menu item displays the title, description and length associated with the currently loaded video. This data is retrieved from the video's metadata in the Playback API.
</p>

<h4>Subtitles</h4>
<p>
Selecting the Subtitles top menu item displays options for showing captions associated with the video. Here, you can manage the subtitles/captions to show during playback.
</p>
