<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The CMS API does not support updating multiple videos with a single request. However, you can iterate over a set of data to this, and this sample demonstrates this, using a sample Brightcove account. To get access tokens and make the API calls, it uses a proxy built by Brightcove Learning services.</p>

<p>Since the aim is just to show the logic, we will just update one bit of metadata for the videos: the description.</p>

<h3>Proxy</h3>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) You can download two versions of our proxy code:
<ul>
	<li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/bcls-proxy-for-distribution.php.zip">This is a general version that expects client credentials to be passed with the request</a></li>
	<li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/doc-samples-proxy.php.zip">This version allows you to save your client credentials in the proxy itself on lines 25-26 (recommended)</a></li>
</ul>
