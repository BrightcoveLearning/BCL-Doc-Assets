<p class="bcls-question">Is Chromecast supported?</p>

<p class="bcls-answer">Neither the Native SDK for Android nor the SDK for IOS has a plugin for this yet, but there is good documentation for the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers">Google Cast SDK</a>, allowing you to create your own integration.
  <br /><br />
  While creating your <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/sender_apps">Google Cast sender app</a>, use Brightcove's <code>Catalog</code> object and the <code>findVideoById</code> method as you normally would. When you get the video source URL, pass it to the Google Cast SDK's <code>loadRemoteMedia</code> method.</p>

<p class="bcls-question">Are playlists supported?</p>

<p class="bcls-answer">Yes, the <code>Catalog</code> class from Brightcove's CMS API service (also known as the Edge API service) allows you to return playlists from your Video Cloud account.</p>
