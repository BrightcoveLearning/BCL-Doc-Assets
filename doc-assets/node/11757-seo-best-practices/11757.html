<h2 id="index">Indexing your site content</h2>

<p>With more internet content being multimedia, you need to make sure that search engines can index your content. There are two ways to accomplish this:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#sitemap">Create a sitemap</a></li>
	<li><a href="#videositemap">Create a video sitemap</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A simple MRSS feed may also work if you don't have the means to produce a video sitemap.</p>

<div id="sitemap" class="BCL-subsection">
<h3>Creating a sitemap</h3>

<p>A sitemap is an XML file that tells search engines about the pages on your website. This file lists URLs for each page along with additional metadata, such as when the page was last updated, how often it usually changes and how important it is relative to other URLs on your site.</p>

<p>Because the sitemap lists pages (URLs), you will want to create a page (URL) for each video in your library. You can do this with a single web page where the content and metadata is set dynamically from the server-side of your application. Use the Video Cloud CMS API to fetch metadata about your video and write it to the web page. This will allow search engines to find every video in your collection and index the metadata for each file.</p>

<p>For details about the XML structure, refer to the <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html"> sitemaps XML format</a> site.</p>

<h2 id="micro">Adding context to HTML content using microformats</h2>

<p>While HTML tags tell the browser how to display your content, it doesn't provide any information about what the content means. Your site may be generated from structured data, probably stored in databases, but the structure is lost when it is formatted in HTML. Search engines can benefit from knowing about the structure of the data on your site.</p>

<p>A collection of schemas (i.e. HTML tags) has been created to identify the type of content on your web pages. Search engines including Bing, Google and Yahoo rely on this markup to improve search results.</p>

<p>These schemas, or microformats, provide you with a collection of shared vocabularies to add to your markup that will define the content on your web page. You can find details about these tags at <a href="http://schema.org/"> schema.org</a>.</p>

<p>For your media player, Brightcove recommends using the <a href="http://schema.org/VideoObject"> VideoObject</a> schema.</p>

<p>Brightcove has created a tool to generate your player publishing code with the microformat data included. Check out the <a href="/node/18027"> Video Schema Builder.</a></p>
