You want to allow users to easily embed an Experience and provide as much flexibility as possible in the generation of the Brightcove Experience embed code so they can control the look and feel without being HTML or JavaScript experts.</p>
    <p>Note that In-Page Experiences are part of Gallery, which is included in the <a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/video-marketing-suite">Video Marketing Suite</a> and <a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/enterprise-video-suite">Enterprise Video Suite</a>, and can also be purchased as an add-on package for Video Cloud. Contact your account manager for details.</p>
