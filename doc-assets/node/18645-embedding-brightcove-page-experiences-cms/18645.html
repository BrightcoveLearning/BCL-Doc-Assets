    <p>In addition to the basic single video players and playlist players, Brightcove offers a multi-video player type, called In-page Experience. You want to allow users to easily embed an Experience and provide as much flexibility as possible in the generation of the Brightcove Experience embed code so they can control the look and feel without being HTML or JavaScript experts.</p>
    <p>Note that In-Page Experiences are part of Gallery, which is included in the <a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/video-marketing-suite">Video Marketing Suite</a> and <a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/enterprise-video-suite">Enterprise Video Suite</a>, and can also be purchased as an add-on package for Video Cloud. Contact your account manager for details.</p>

    <h2 id="In_page_Experience_selection_dialog">In-page Experience selection dialog</h2>
    <p>There should be a dialog allowing the user to choose an In-page Experience. This dialog should allow the user to set the fields listed below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Brightcove Account:</strong> The user should be able to choose a Brightcove account if one is not already selected.</li>
      <li><strong>Search Filter:</strong> The user should be able to enter a search string to filter the list of displayed Experiences. If using Brightcove search API, the search string should be URI encoded.</li>
      <li><strong>Order:</strong> The list of displayed Experiences should be sorted by name. The user should be able to select ascending or descending sort order. The default should be ascending.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The dialog should have the following behavior:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Display a list of Experiences based on the user selection above. Allow the user to select one Experience.</li>
      <li>
        For the displayed list of Experiences:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Only published Experiences should be displayed</li>
          <li>The Experience name, template, and ID should be shown.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Display a clickable link that will open the Experience player in a new browser tab.</li>
    </ol>
