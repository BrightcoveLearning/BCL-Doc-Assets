    <p>In addition to the basic single video players and playlist players, Brightcove offers a multi-video player type, called In-page Experience. You want to allow users to easily embed an Experience and provide as much flexibility as possible in the generation of the Brightcove Experience embed code so they can control the look and feel without being HTML or JavaScript experts.</p>
    <p>Note that In-Page Experiences are part of Gallery, which is included in the <a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/video-marketing-suite">Video Marketing Suite</a> and <a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/enterprise-video-suite">Enterprise Video Suite</a>, and can also be purchased as an add-on package for Video Cloud. Contact your account manager for details.</p>

    <h2 id="In_page_Experience_selection_dialog">In-page Experience selection dialog</h2>
    <p>There should be a dialog allowing the user to choose an In-page Experience. This dialog should allow the user to set the fields listed below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Brightcove Account:</strong> The user should be able to choose a Brightcove account if one is not already selected.</li>
      <li><strong>Search Filter:</strong> The user should be able to enter a search string to filter the list of displayed Experiences. If using Brightcove search API, the search string should be URI encoded.</li>
      <li><strong>Order:</strong> The list of displayed Experiences should be sorted by name. The user should be able to select ascending or descending sort order. The default should be ascending.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The dialog should have the following behavior:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Display a list of Experiences based on the user selection above. Allow the user to select one Experience.</li>
      <li>
        For the displayed list of Experiences:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Only published Experiences should be displayed</li>
          <li>The Experience name, template, and ID should be shown.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Display a clickable link that will open the Experience player in a new browser tab.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>There should be a dialog allowing the user to control the formatting of the In-page Experience on the web page. This dialog should allow the user to set the fields listed below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><code>Embed Type:</code> The user should be able to choose between iFrame and Javascript embed code. The default should be Javascript.</li>
    <li>
      <code>Sizing:</code> The user should be able to select between Responsive or Fixed sizing.<sup><strong><a href="#note1-1">[1-1]</a></strong></sup>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If iFrame, the default should be Fixed and Responsive should disabled.</li>
        <li>If Javascript, the default should be Responsive.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>Width, Height:</code> The user should be able to enter Width and Height.<sup><strong><a href="#note1-1">[1-1]</a></strong></sup>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If iFrame, the default should be Fixed and Responsive should disabled.</li>
        <li>If Responsive, the Width and Height should be disabled.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><code>Override Experience Videos:</code> The user should be able to override the default videos in an Experience with a list of videos or with a playlist. If the user selects to overrides the Experience videos, allow the user to choose videos or a playlist per the “Overriding Experience Videos” section below.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The dialog should have the following additional behavior:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The generated Brightcove embed code should be displayed to the user in the dialog.</li>
    <li>The user should be able to make edits to the embed code. Even though we are trying to give the user as much flexibility as possible in configuring the embed code, there might be cases where they need to override what is automatically generated.</li>
    <li>If the user modifies one of the previous selections in the dialog, the user’s edits will be overwritten by newly generated code.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li id="note1-1"><sup><strong>[1-1]</strong></sup> If the CMS provides a native container for embedding code that allows the user to specify Responsive vs Fixed and Width/Height, it might make more sense to use the container for sizing and have the Brightcove embed code always be responsive.</li>
