<h2>Meaning</h2>

<p>This error occurs when we can't decode a media file. Usually, it means that the file itself is corrupt and can't be decoded. We support just about everything, so usually this indicates a corrupt file.</p>

<p>Occasionally, it means that the file uses an input codec that we don't support, and haven't seen before. (Known codec failures get an <a href="UnsupportedCodecError.html">UnsupportedCodecError</a>.) Either way, we'll see if there's anything we can do to get the file working. Sometimes we can fix the corruption or add codec support, but sometimes the file is just irreversibly corrupt. In any case, feel free to <a href="http://zencoder.com/contact">contact us</a> for specific details.</p>
