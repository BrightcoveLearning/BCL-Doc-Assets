<p>Portal experiences can easily be previewed during development. Links to preview the site can also be shared. When the site is complete, it can be published to make it publicly available.</p>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="preview">Previewing a portal experience</h2>

<p>Previewing an experience lets you see how the experience is going to display on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. To preview an experience, edit the experience and then click <strong>Preview</strong> in the Gallery Site Editor.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node13599-preview.png" /></div>

<p>There are two options:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Responsive Preview</strong> - Opens the experience in a new browser window for preview</li>
	<li class="language-editable"><strong>Get Shareable Link</strong> - Provides a preview URL so the preview can be shared with others.</li>
</ul>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node13599-shareable-link1.png" /></div>

<p>The Shareable URL that is generated is valid for 72 hours.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside language-editable">>Note: If you have configured any session timeout as part of any access control settings, the 72 hour timeout will override your configured session timeout. When the experience is published, the session timeout (if any) will be enforced.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="publish">Publishing a portal experience</h2>

<p>Publishing a portal experience makes it available to viewers and generates a static URL for the site. To publish an experience, follow these steps:</p>

<p class="BCL-aside language-editable">>Note: If you recently made changes to video metadata or playlists, those changes may take up to 6 minutes to appear on published experiences.</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li class="language-editable">Click on the experience name to open the site in the Site Editor.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">Click <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
	<li class="language-editable">On the Publish Confirmation dialog, click <strong>Publish Now</strong>.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node13599-confirm-publish1.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li class="language-editable">The experience will be published and the site URL will be displayed.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node13599-publish-url1.png" /></div>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>bcvp0rtal</code> domain supports SSL by default so sites can also be accessed using <strong>https://</strong>, no setup or SSL certificates are required. It is also possible to secure the site using your own SSL certificates. For information, see <a href="/node/15951">Securing a Portal Experience with SSL</a>.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside language-editable">>Note: For information on how to host the experience on your own domain, see <a href="/node/16442">Assigning a Custom Domain to a Portal Experience</a>.</p>

<p>Once the experience is published, the URL will be displayed as part of the site details on the Gallery home page.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node13599-site-details-url1.png" /></div>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="changes">Publishing changes to a portal experience</h2>

<p>When you make changes to an experience, you must republish the site to make the changes available. Experiences that need to be republished will display an Experience Status of <strong>Unpublished Changes </strong>as part of the site details.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node13599-publish-changes1.png" /></div>

<p>To republish the changes, follow the steps outlined in the <a href="#publish">Publishing a site</a> section of this topic.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside language-editable">>Note: You may need to clear the browser cache and cookies if changes aren't appearing.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="search">Getting a portal experience indexed by search engines</h2>

<p>Once the site is published, there are some steps you can take to help get the site indexed by search engines. For information on this topic, see <a href="/node/13985">Indexing a Gallery Portal Experience</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="offline">Taking a portal experience offline</h2>

<p>Taking an experience offline makes it no longer available at its URL. To take an experience offline, click on a row and then click <strong>Take Offline</strong>. To confirm that the experience should be taken offline, click <strong>Take Offline</strong>. To make the experience available again, the experience must be republished. Once the experience is offline, it no longer will be reachable via its URL.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside language-editable">>Note: Taking the experience offline does not delete the experience.</p>
