<p>The MD5 checksum computed for the input file does not match the checksum supplied to the API.</p>

<p>There are a variety of possible causes for this problem. The most likely are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The file was corrupted in transit.</li>
	<li>The checksum supplied to the API was incorrect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check to make sure that the checksum you supplied to the API matches the checksum of the file on disk.</p>

<p>If they <em>don't</em> match, please make a new API call with the proper checksum.</p>

<p>If the checksums <em>do</em> match, the file may have been corrupted during transfer. Please resubmit the job.</p>

<p>In either case, if the retry fails, please contact us.</p>
