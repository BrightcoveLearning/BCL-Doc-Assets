<p>For example, Apple recommends providing at least one stream at 192 kbps or lower bandwidth for HLS over cellular networks. This low-bandwidth stream could be audio-only or audio with a still image, but you should strive to have video in this stream.</p>

<h2 id="creating">Creating audio-only renditions</h2>

<p>To create audio-only renditions, add an audio-only ingest profile to your account and then use either the Dynamic Ingest API or the Upload module in Video Cloud Studio. For details, see the <a href="/node/18041">Standard Ingest Profiles</a> developer document.</p>

<p>Once you have set your audio-only ingest profile, then every time you upload a video, whether you use the Upload module, or the Dynamic Ingest API, the video will include an audio-only rendition along with the other multi-bitrate renditions that are included in your ingest profile.</p>

<p>Your existing video content will not automatically have an audio-only rendition. To create audio-only renditions for your existing videos, you need to re-encode them. See <a href="/node/15921">Retranscoding Videos using the Media Module</a>.</p>

<p>When an audio-only rendition is&nbsp;played back on&nbsp;an Apple iOS device, the QuickTime player is displayed. In a Flash player, a black video display is shown.</p>
