<p>In the following example, you will see the player with a playlist appearing to the right. The playlist is populated by retrieving the most popular videos, based on most number of plays, via the CMS API.</p>

<div class="bcls-expander-content">
<p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong>Result</strong> button.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
	<li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Applicaton_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
	<ol>
		<li>Click the <strong>EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
		<li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
		<li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Applicaton_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>

<h2 id="developmentsequence" class="bcls-expander-head">Development sequence</h2>

<div class="bcls-expander-content">
<p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
	<li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
	<li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
	<li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
	<li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
</ol>

<p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/node/18081">Quick Start: Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>

<h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>

<p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
	<li>Automatically responsive</li>
	<li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
</ul>

<p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
	<li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
	<li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

<!-- UPDATE player and HTML configuration -->

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</h2>

<p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>

<h3>Player configuration</h3>

<p>No special configuration is required for the Brightcove Player you create for this sample.</p>

<h3>Other HTML</h3>

<p>A <code>div</code> element is added to specify the location of the playlist:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-html">&lt;div class="vjs-playlist"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</section>
<!-- UPDATE application flow -->

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>

<p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Build an object with info for API call.</li>
	<li>Call the CMS API to return the 10 most watched videos.</li>
	<li>Extract the video IDs from the returned data.</li>
	<li>For each ID, use the Video Cloud catalog to get the corresponding video object. Store the video objects in an array.</li>
	<li>Assign the array of video objects to the player as a playlist.</li>
</ul>
<!-- UPDATE task 1 -->

<h3>Create object with API call info</h3>

<p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// +++ Initialize variables and option object for CMS API call +++</code></pre>

<p>The key information needed for the API call are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Account ID</li>
	<li>Base URL</li>
	<li>End point</li>
	<li>HTTP method</li>
</ul>

<p>Variables are then concatenated to create properly formed values for the API call.</p>
<!-- UPDATE task 2 -->

<h3>Make the CMS API request</h3>

<p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// +++ Make the CMS API request to get matching video IDs +++</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>makeRequest()</code> method is called and the options object, built earlier, and a callback function are passed to the method. The information returned by the CMS API will be returned in the <code>mostWatchedVideos</code> parameter. The data is returned as a string, so it needs to be JSON parsed to be usable.</p>
<!-- UPDATE task 3 -->

<h3>Extract video IDs from returned data</h3>

<p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// +++ Helper Function: Extract video IDs from data CMS API response +++</code></pre>

<p>The <code>extractVideoData()</code> method loops over the data returned from the CMS API and extracts the IDs, and pushing them into an array.</p>
<!-- UPDATE task 2 -->

<h3>Retrieve video objects based on extracted IDs</h3>

<p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// +++ Helper Function: Retrieve video objects from video IDs +++</code></pre>

<p>The <code>catalog.getVideo()</code> method is used to get the video object, then the objects are pushed into another array, this one containing the video objects.</p>
<!-- UPDATE task 3 -->

<h3>Assign array of video objects to the player's playlist</h3>

<p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// Add the most watched videos list to the player as a playlist</code></pre>

<p>The Playlist API's <code>playlist()</code> method is used to assign the array of video objects to the the player's playlist.</p>
</section>
<!-- UPDATE CSS description -->

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>

<p>The CSS is used to position size the player and playlist.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>

<p>Normally when converting the JavaScript into a Brightcove Player plugin nominal changes are needed. One required change is to replace the standard use of the <code>ready()</code> method with the code that defines a plugin.</p>

<p>Here is the very commonly used start to JavaScript code that will work with the player:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript">videojs('myPlayerID').ready(function(){
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>

<p>You will change the first line to use the standard syntax to start a Brightcove Player plugin:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript">videojs.registerPlugin('pluginName', function(options) {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>
<!-- UPDATE path to plugin's JavaScript -->

<p>As mentioned earlier, you can see the plugin's JavaScript code in this document's corresponding GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18175-most-watched-videos-playlist/blob/master/plugin/most-watched-playlist.js">most-watched-playlist.js</a>.</p>

<h3>Using the plugin with a player</h3>

<p>Once you have the plugin's CSS and JavaScript files stored in an Internet accessible location, you can use the plugin with a player. In Studio's <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module you can choose a player, then in the <strong>PLUGINS</strong> section add the URLs to the CSS and JavaScript files, and also add the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Options</strong>, if options are needed.</p>
