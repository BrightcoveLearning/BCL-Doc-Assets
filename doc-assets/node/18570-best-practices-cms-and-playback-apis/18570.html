    <p>Both the CMS and Playback APIs provide access to your Video Cloud video data. The purpose of this topic is to help you understand the difference between them and the best practices for using them.</p>

  <h2 id="differences_between">Differences between the CMS and Playback APIs</h2>
  <p>The CMS and Playback APIs access the same underlying video data. There are some key differences between them that should determine which one you use in particular situations, however.</p>
  <p>Generally speaking, the CMS API is intended for backend use, such as integrating Video Cloud with your CMS system. The Playback API is intended for frontend use to fetch video and playlist data for players or video portals (the Brightcove Player <code>catalog</code> and <code>playlist</code> APIs use the Playback API, for example).</p>
  <p>The table below lists some key differences between the two APIs.</p>

    <h2 id="media_urls">Media URLs</h2>
    <p>It is important to understand that URLs for renditions, images, and other assets are not fixed. Brightcove reconfigures the storage of media assets from time to time, and when this happens, URLs for specific assets will change. If you are relying on hard-coded URLs to these assets in your pages or apps, the links will break at some point.</p>
    <p>In addition, all URLs contain a <code>TTL</code> token for content security reasons. This means that the URLs expire after a short time. The life of the token can be extended up to 365 days - if you want longer-lived tokens,  <a href="https://help.brightcove.com/en/contact">Contact Brightcove Support</a>.</p>
    <p>The best way to prevent links to media from breaking is to retrieve them from Video Cloud at runtime using the CMS API or the <a href="/node/18380">Playback API</a>.</p>
    <section class="bcls-subsection">
    <h3>Caching</h3>
    <p>If a runtime API request is not an option, then recommend getting the URL(s) from a local data cache that is refreshed at least once a day, or within time-to-live set for your <code>TTL</code> tokens, whichever is shorter.</p>
