    <p>It is important to understand that URLs for renditions, images, and other assets are not fixed. Brightcove reconfigures the storage of media assets from time to time, and when this happens, URLs for specific assets will change. If you are relying on hard-coded URLs to these assets in your pages or apps, the links will break at some point. The best way to prevent links to media from breaking is to retrieve them from Video Cloud at runtime using the CMS API or the <a href="/node/18380">Playback API</a>.</p>
