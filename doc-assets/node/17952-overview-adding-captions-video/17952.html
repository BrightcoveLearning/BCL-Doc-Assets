<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>Closed captions can be added to videos to provide additional or interpretive information to individuals who wish to access it. Captions are necessary so the deaf and hard of hearing can access the audio portion of video presentations.</p>

<figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Example of Captions" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/17952-overview-adding-captions-video/assets/samplecaptions.png" />

<p>Such text may be used for accessibility, to provide translations of the audio track or some other purpose, but the underlying technology used is the same.</p>

<h2 id="players">Brightcove Players vs. Smart Players</h2>

<p>Although captions look similar in the Brightcove Player and the legacy Smart Player, the underlying technologies are significantly different:</p>

<table class="bcls-table">
	<caption class="bcls-caption--table">Captions in the Brightcove Player and Smart Player</caption>
	<thead class="bcls-table__head">
		<tr>
			<th>Player</th>
			<th>Captions format</th>
			<th>File extension</th>
			<th>Cross-domain control</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody class="bcls-table__body">
		<tr>
			<td>Brightcove Player</td>
			<td>WebVTT (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/">text tracks</a>). (Note that WebVTT is a general syntax for providing information about time-based events during video playback, and may be used for other purposes such as specifying <a href="/node/18078">video chapters</a> as well.)</td>
			<td>.vtt</td>
			<td><a href="http://enable-cors.org">CORS</a></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Smart Player (legacy)</td>
			<td>DFXP</td>
			<td>.xml</td>
			<td><a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet/adobe-media-server/articles/cross-domain-xml-for-streaming.html">crossdomain.xml</a></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<p>The remainder of this document deals with WebVTT captions (text tracks), since that is the technology used for the Brightcove Player.</p>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="filelocation">Captions file location</h2>

<p>You can choose where to host the WebVTT captions file:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>At a Remote URL (remote asset)</strong> - In this case, the WebVTT file is hosted on your server and you add the URL for the file to the video metadata.

	<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you are hosting captions files on your own server, make sure the file is located at a URL that can be accessed by the Brightcove player. The server hosting the captions file should also have Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled. You can read more about CORS <a href="/node/17916">here</a>.</aside>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Uploaded using Video Cloud</strong> (<strong>ingested</strong>) - In this case, the WebVTT file is uploaded (ingested) to Video Cloud. This can be done using the Media module or using the APIs.</li>
</ol>

<section id="associate" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Associating captions with a video</h2>

<p>There are several ways to associate a captions file with a video:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Using Studio</li>
	<li>Modifying the player publishing code</li>
	<li>Using the APIs</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="studio">Adding captions in Studio</h3>

<p>Captions can be associated with a video using the Media module. For information, see <a href="/node/15481">Adding Captions to Videos using the Media Module</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pubcode">Modifying the player publishing code</h3>

<p>In this case, a <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> tag is added to the player publishing code. For more information, see <a href="/node/18076">Programmatically Adding Captions to Videos</a>.</p>

<h3 id="api">Adding captions via the APIs</h3>

<p>How you add captions via the APIs varies depending on whether the captions file will be ingested or used as a remote asset.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">There is a <code>/caption</code> endpoint for the CMS API, but this is used <strong>only</strong> for DFXP captions for the Smart Player.</aside>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Remote asset captions</strong> - If you prefer to host the captions yourself (or have a captions provider who hosts them), then you can associate the captions with a video using the CMS API. For information, see <a href="/node/18013">Using the CMS API: Add WebVTT Captions</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Add captions to Video Cloud</strong> - If you want to have Brightcove host your captions, you can ingest your WebVTT file using the Dynamic Ingest API. For information, see <a href="/node/17938">Ingesting WebVTT Files</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="remove" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Removing captions</h2>

<p>WebVTT captions can be removed from videos using the Media module or via the CMS API. In Studio, open the Media module and edit the video properties. Edit the <strong>Text Tracks</strong> property as needed.</p>

<p>Captions can also be removed using the CMS API by making an <a href="https://brightcovelearning.github.io/Brightcove-API-References/cms-api/v1/doc/index.html#api-videoGroup-Update_Video">Update Video</a> request and submitting a request body with an empty <code>text_tracks</code> array (or an array from which the object associated with that set of captions has been removed).</p>
</section>

<section id="styling" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Styling captions</h2>

<p>Styling can be applied to WebVTT captions using CSS. See <a href="/node/18314">Styling Captions</a> for details.</p>
