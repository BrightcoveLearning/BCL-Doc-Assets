     Apple continually makes updates to its iOS operating system, which affects the technology that the Brightcove SDK is built around. In order to focus on cutting edge features, we must evolve alongside Apple by providing support for only the relevant versions of iOS.
   </p>
<p>Support for the Brightcove Native Player SDK for iOS is defined in terms of the major.minor.revision of an OS (for example: iOS 11.1.2). Only the latest revision of a version is supported. Customers can still use the Brightcove SDK for iOS on unsupported versions, however we provide no guarantee of functionality.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

<h3 class="BCL_subsectionTitle">Apple’s App Store</h3>

<p>Apple’s App Store provides usage data that shows which iOS versions have logged into the App Store on a highlighted day. As of November 6th 2017, this data shows that 90% of devices connected to the App Store are running either iOS 11 or iOS 10. For current details, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/">Apple's App Store data</a>.</p>

<p>Quick adoption by a considerably large percent of the market is a long running trend in the iOS market and is traditionally accelerated at the end of the year due to the holidays. Further historical data on adoption rates for new versions of iOS can be seen at <a href="https://mixpanel.com/trends/#report/ios_11">mixpanel.com</a>.</p>

<!-- <h3 class="BCL_subsectionTitle">iOS SDK Streams</h3>

<p>In addition to examining the App Store data, we can also review traffic across different iOS versions from apps built using the Brightcove SDK. This gives us an idea of where videos are actually being watched.</p>

<p>Data from the Brightcove Native SDK for iOS not only reinforces the trends observed in the App Store above, but it also shows how much more active recent versions of iOS are used for consuming video. While the App Store data shows 8% of logins coming from devices running systems older than iOS9, the video playback specific data shows 0% usage from devices running iOS7.</p> -->
