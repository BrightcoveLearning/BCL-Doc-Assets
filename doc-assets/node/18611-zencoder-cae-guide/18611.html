<p>Context Aware Encoding (CAE) analyzes each source video and intelligently builds a custom bitrate ladder (set of renditions) for each piece of content. In addition, Context Aware Encoding takes into account constraints associated with the delivery network and device being used to view the content. It decides how many renditions are needed and what resolutions and bitrates to use for each, while still maintaining a consistent level of quality across all titles. This results in massive savings on storage and bandwidth costs, while improving the playback experience for users. For additional information, please see the <a href="/node/18505">Overview of Context Aware Encoding</a>.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Context Aware Encoding is not available to all Zencoder customers. If you have questions about whether or not you can use Context Aware Encoding, please contact your Account Manager.</aside>

  <p>CAE is enabled on a Zencoder Job by setting <code><a href="/node/17878#generate_dynamic_profile">generate_dynamic_profile</a></code> to true and adding <a href="/node/17852#dynamic_profile_rendition">dynamic_profile_rendition</a> values to Outputs of the Job.  (Optionally, <a href="/node/18610">dynamic_profile_options</a> may also be configured.  After downloading and inspecting the Input source file for the Job, Zencoder runs the CAE dynamic profile generator on the source file. The resulting dynamic profile ladder settings are added to each corresponding Output before they are encoded.  The following settings are automatically set for Outputs with a dynamic_profile_rendition value: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>width</li>
    <li>height</li>
    <li>frame_rate</li>
    <li>video_codec</li>
    <li>video_codec_profile</li>
    <li>video_codec_tier</li>
    <li>video_codec_level</li>
    <li>video_reference_frames</li>
    <li>video_bframes</li>
    <li>video_bitrate</li>
    <li>decoder_bitrate_cap</li>
    <li>decoder_buffer_size</li>
    <li>keyframe_rate</li>
    <li>fixed_keyframe_interval</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Other Outputs without a <a href="/node/17852#dynamic_profile_rendition">dynamic_profile_rendition</a> will begin encoding as soon as the Input source is inspected, concurrently while the the dynamic profile generator is running.</p>

  <h3>Number of Renditions</h3>
  <p>The minimum and maximum number of renditions to create is controlled with the <a href="/node/18610#min_renditions">min_renditions</a> and <a href="/node/18610#max_renditions">max_renditions</a> settings. For best performance, it is recommended to leave a certain gap between these limits (e.g. set <code>min_renditions</code> to 2 and <code>max_renditions</code> to 10), allowing CAE profile generator to select number most suitable for each content. For easy to encode content, it may produce fewer renditions, while for more complex content it may produce more. It is also recommended to set min_renditions to be as small as possible, to allow for saving bandwidth when more renditions are unnecessary.</p>
  <h3>Resolutions</h3>
  <p>By default, CAE uses a ladder of about 30 standard resolutions, ranging from 192x108 to 7680x4320. It can be limited on either the low or high end by using the <a href="/node/18610#min_resolution">min_resolution</a> and max_resolution settings. Alternately, a custom list of resolutions and associated codec settings can be provided in the  video_configurations setting.</p>
