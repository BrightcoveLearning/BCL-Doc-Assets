<p>Context Aware Encoding analyzes each source video and intelligently builds a custom bitrate ladder (set of renditions) for each piece of content. In addition, Context Aware Encoding takes into account constraints associated with the delivery network and device being used to view the content. It decides how many renditions are needed and what resolutions and bitrates to use for each, while still maintaining a consistent level of quality across all titles. This results in massive savings on storage and bandwidth costs, while improving the playback experience for users. For additional information, please see the <a href="/node/18505">Overview of Context Aware Encoding</a>.</p>
