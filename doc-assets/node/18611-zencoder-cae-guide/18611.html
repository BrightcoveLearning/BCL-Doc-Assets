<p>Context Aware Encoding (CAE) analyzes each source video and intelligently builds a custom bitrate ladder (set of renditions) for each piece of content. In addition, Context Aware Encoding takes into account constraints associated with the delivery network and device being used to view the content. It decides how many renditions are needed and what resolutions and bitrates to use for each, while still maintaining a consistent level of quality across all titles. This results in massive savings on storage and bandwidth costs, while improving the playback experience for users. For additional information, please see the <a href="/node/18505">Overview of Context Aware Encoding</a>.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Context Aware Encoding is not available to all Zencoder customers. If you have questions about whether or not you can use Context Aware Encoding, please contact your Account Manager.</aside>

  <p>CAE is enabled on a Zencoder Job by setting <code><a href="/node/17878#generate_dynamic_profile">generate_dynamic_profile</a></code> to true and adding dynamic_profile_rendition values to Outputs of the Job.  (Optionally, dynamic_profile_options may also be configured.)  After downloading and inspecting the Input source file for the Job, Zencoder runs the CAE dynamic profile generator on the source file.  The resulting dynamic profile ladder settings are added to each corresponding Output before they are encoded.  The following settings are automatically set for Outputs with a dynamic_profile_rendition value: </p>
