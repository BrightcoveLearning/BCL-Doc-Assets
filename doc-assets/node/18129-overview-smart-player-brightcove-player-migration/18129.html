<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The Brightcove Player, which replaces the Smart Player, is an HTML-first video player that will deliver video entirely through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in almost all cases. It is also considerably lighter and loads faster than the Smart Player, and it has a more robust plugin architecture that allows a broader range of customizations. Because of this and the fact that the internet is rapidly moving away from Flash, you are encouraged to migrate your content to the Brightcove Player as soon as it is practical to do so.</p>

<p>This guide will help you transition from using the Smart Player to using the Brightcove Player. To learn more about this player, see the <a href="/node/18204">Brightcove Player Overview</a> document.</p>

<p>For a comparison between the two APIs, see the <a href="/node/18115">Smart Player to Brightcove Player API Comparison</a>.</p>

<p>This guide contains the following:</p>

<h2 id="Media_compatibilty">Media compatibilty</h2>

<p>Although there is considerable overlap between the media formats that the Smart Player and Brightcove Player support, the underlying technologies are entirely different. Therefore different formats are optimum for the two players. The Smart Player, using Flash by default, works best with streaming MP4 video, while the Brightcove Player, built on HTML and JavaScript, works best with video in HLS format (or MPEG-DASH for DRM-protected videos).</p>

<p>You will have access to all of your video content that you have uploaded using legacy Studio. Simply login to the <a href="https://signin.brightcove.com">new Studio</a> platform and browse your content in the <strong>Media</strong> module.</p>

<p>However, because the Brightcove player works best with HLS content, you may need to update the renditions you have to take advantage of the Brightcove Player's playback technology. <span class="video-cloud-only">See the <a href="/node/18146">Video Renditions Inspector</a> for help in determining whether your videos have renditions suitable for the Brightcove Player.</span></p>

<p class="video-cloud-only">The next section explains ingest profiles, and how you can use these to insure that you have video renditions best suited to the players you are using.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section video-cloud-only">
<h2 id="Ingest_profiles">Ingest profiles</h2>

<p>When videos are uploaded using the legacy studio, the renditions created are based upon the transcode settings configured for the account. All uploaded videos use the same transcode settings. In the new studio, videos uploaded using the Upload module use ingest profiles to determine which, and how many, renditions are created. Different videos can use <a href="/node/15628">different ingest profiles</a>. Publishers can also create their own ingest profiles.</p>

<p>Ingest Profiles can also be created and managed using the <a href="/node/18045">Overview: Ingest Profiles API</a>.</p>

<p>If you have integration between your CMS and Video Cloud, you will also want to update that to take advantage of the new APIs:</p>

</ul>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Playback_technology">Playback technology</h2>

<p>The Smart Player uses Flash-first technology to play your content. If the browser does not support Flash, then HTML technology is used with a feature-limited player. The Brightcove Player is able to play most of your content using HTML5, including HLS. If it cannot, it falls back to using Flash.</p>

<p>For details, see the <a href="/node/18144">Guide: Playback Technology</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Player_implementations">Player implementations</h2>

<p>Smart Players are usually implemented using the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag in your HTML page. You can also use the player URL as the <code>src</code> value for an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, but you will need to size the iframe appropriately using CSS.</p>

<p>Brightcove Players have two implementations to choose from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Standard</strong> implementation uses an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Advanced</strong> implementation uses a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag is most similar to the Smart Player implementation, the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag offers some distinct advantages.</p>

<p>Learn about <a href="/node/15622">Choosing the Correct Embed&nbsp;Code</a>.</p>

<p>Also note that you can obtain the Brightcove Player embed codes using the <a href="/node/18269">Overview: Player Management APII</a> if you are integrating your CMS with Video Cloud.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Player_templates">Player templates</h2>

<p>When creating a new Smart Player, all players are based upon a player template. Brightcove provides a set of player templates, or you can create your own custom templates using BEML.</p>

<p>Brightcove Players are based on the single video player template. You can duplicate the default player or create a new player, and then add any features and customizations that you wish.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Player_plugins">Player plugins</h2>

<p>Both the legacy Smart Player and the Brightcove Player have plugin architectures, but they are quite different. <strong>Plugins created for the Smart Player will not work in the Brightcove Player!</strong>. You can probably reuse some of the code from Smart Player JavaScript plugins, but the APIs for the two players are different - see <a href="#API_comparison">API Comparison</a> below.</p>

<p>There are a number of <a href="/node/18093">plugins created by Brightcove</a> for the Brightcove Player, and also some <a href="/node/17929">open-source plugins</a>.</p>

<p>To create plugins for the Brightcove Player, see the <a href="/node/18081">Quick Start: Developing Plugins</a>.</p>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="configuration">Player configuration</h2>

<p>This section should help you to identify how your Smart Player was configured, and point you to the appropriate documents to obtain the same features and functionality in the Brightcove Player.</p>
