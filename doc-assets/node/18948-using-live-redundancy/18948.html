    <p>Brightcove Live's redundancy feature helps to insure reliable performance for your live events by creating a backup stream that Live will automatically failover to in the event that the first stream stops working.</p>

    <p>For the redundant setup, you will need to create 2 or more Brightcove Live Jobs. The only requirement of the Jobs is that they are created with the <strong>same</strong> <code>output</code> settings. The easiest way to achieve this is to create one job with the output specifications you want, and then use the <code>copy_outputs_from_job</code> parameter to create the additional jobs.</p>
    <p>There is no restriction on the regions these jobs can be created in, however, it is recommended they are located relatively nearby each other.</p>
    <p>After the Live Jobs have been created, hold onto the Job IDs for later. The request body you will use to add these jobs to a redundant group (see the sections below) will look like this:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-json">[
  {
    "job_id": "0b76bc73f92f46dc917bbe5061c0c633"
  },
  {
    "job_id": "0ae5a4a71dc54b3181af0f98ee407c27"
  }
]</code></pre>
