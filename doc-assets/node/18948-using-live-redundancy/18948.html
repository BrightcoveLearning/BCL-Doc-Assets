    <p>For the redundant setup, you will need to create 2 or more Brightcove Live Jobs. The only requirement of the Jobs is that they are created with the <strong>same</strong> <code>output</code> settings. The easiest way to achieve this is to create one job with the output specifications you want, and then use the <code>copy_outputs_from_job</code> parameter to create the additional jobs.</p>
