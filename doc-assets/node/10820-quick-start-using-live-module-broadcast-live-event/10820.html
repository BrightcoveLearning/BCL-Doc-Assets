</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<p>After completing this Quick Start, you should be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use the Video Cloud Live module to create a live event</li>
	<li>Configure your encoder for a live event</li>
	<li>Trim your event and save it as a VOD asset in your Video Cloud account</li>
	<li>Monitor the health of your live streams</li>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="prereq">Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
	<li>A Video Cloud Pro or Enterprise account with access to the Live module; you can sign up for a Live module trial <a href="http://go.brightcove.com/forms/video-cloud-live-module">here</a></li>
	<li>A camera to broadcast the event</li>
	<li>You must have your own encoding software; this Quick Start uses <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-media-encoder.html">Adobe Flash Live Media Encoder</a> which can be downloaded for free (see a list of <a href="https://app.zencoder.com/docs/guides/encoding-settings/using-live-streaming#supported-encoders">supported encoders</a>)</li>

	<li>Live broadcasts will experience a 20-30 second delay</li>
	<li>Maximum of 26 continuous event hours</li>
	<li>Streaming must begin within 30 minutes of the event start</li>
	<li>HD is defined as video with a height of 720 and up; SD is video with a height below 720</li>
	<li>Akamai HD must be used as the Content Delivery Network (CDN)</li>

<h2 id="using">Using the Video Cloud Live module to broadcast a live event</h2>

<p>To stream your live event using the Live module, you will complete the following tasks:</p>

<h3 id="liveapp">Enter your event information using the Video Cloud Live module</h3>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>In a browser window, navigate to <a href="https://studio.brightcove.com">Video Cloud Studio</a>.</li>
	<li>Enter your Video Cloud login credentials and click<strong> Sign In.</strong></li>
	<li>The current Video Cloud account name will appear in the upper right corner of the page. If you have multiple accounts, click the account selector drop down and select the account you would like to save the live asset in. If you select an account that has not been enabled for Live, the Live module will open in trial mode.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node10820-account-selector.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Live</strong> in the navigation header.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Add An Event</strong> button to create a new event.</li>
	<li>On the Create Your Event dialog, add details for your live event and click <strong>Save and Continue</strong>. Note that the broadcast name, short description, tags and reference ID will be associated with the live event asset in Video Cloud.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Event Name </strong>- top level name for the event; this name is internal to the Live module</li>
		<li><strong>Broadcast Name</strong> - name for the broadcast
		<p class="BCL-aside">Note: It is possible for an event to have multiple broadcasts but using multiple broadcasts is only recommended when using a Smart Player. If you are publishing an event using a Brightcove Player, Brightcove recommends creating new events. In this case, using the reference id in place of the video ID in the publishing code will allow you to use the same publishing code for different events. For information on working with Reference IDs, see <a href="/node/18117">Using Reference IDs</a>.</p>

		<p class="BCL-aside">Note: While it is possible to click New Broadcast after an event has completed to start a new broadcast, Brightcove has seen cases where when using a Brightcove Player, old stream content displays instead of the current stream. Brightcove recommends creating new events vs. creating a new broadcast.</p>

		<p class="BCL-aside">Note: When using the reference ID in the player publishing code, Brightcove recommends that there is at least one hour between events due to the Playback API cache.</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Short Description</strong> - description of the event</li>
		<li><strong>Tags</strong> - tags to associate with the event</li>
		<li><strong>Reference ID</strong> - reference ID associated with the event</li>
		<li><strong>Event Date</strong> - planned date of the event; for informational purposes only and has no effect on the event</li>

	<li>On the Select a Player dialog, select the player to use for the event. The drop down list will display the single video players in your Video Cloud account. Both Brightcove Players and Smart Players are supported. Brightcove Players will have <strong>(New Brightcove Player)</strong> following the player name. This quick start will use a Brightcove Player. Click <strong>Save and Continue</strong>.
	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The copy to clipboard buttons require that Flash is installed and enabled. These buttons do not work when using the Microsoft Edge browser.</p>

	<li>The Your Output Options dialog allows you to select a predefined transcoding profile for the event. Each profile has a set of transcode settings associated with it. Select a transcoding profile and then click <strong>View Details</strong> link to see the rendition details.
	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The transcoding profiles that appear are based upon your Live module subscription plan.</p>

	<li>The Brightcove Player does not support RTMP renditions. In an earlier step a Brightcove Player was selected so we will create a custom profile with only HLS renditions. Click <strong>Edit Profile</strong>.
	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: If using a Smart Player, RTMP renditions are supported.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Change the RTMP renditions to HLS. If any renditions are similar, you may want to delete them or edit the Video Bitrate. For this quick start, the following renditions will be used.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node10820-custom-output.png" /></div>
	</li>
	<li>Change the profile <strong>Name</strong> to <strong>Live - HD Brightcove Player</strong>. Click <strong>Save As New</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Start Streaming</strong>. The Live module will return a <strong>Stream URL</strong> and <strong>Stream Name</strong>. These values will be used in the encoder settings. If you <strong>Show</strong> the Live Event Player information, you will see a <strong>URL</strong> which you can use to access your live stream. In the Live Event Player pane, you can choose to copy the URL or the embed code for the live event player.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node10820-encoder-settings.png" /></div>

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: After creating a new live event, an asset for the live event will be created inside of the Media module. This asset <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> be deleted until the event has finished streaming. Deleting the live asset before the event has started streaming will cause errors inside of the Live module.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshoot">Troubleshooting live stream issues</h2>

<p>If you are having issues with your encoder, for example, if you receive a "Failure to connect to primary server" error, make sure that port 1935 is open on your network. Zencoder uses RTMP to accept the input stream and it uses this port.</p>

<p>The Video Cloud Live module can be used to view stream information and can be helpful when troubleshooting live stream errors. Brightcove Support is also available to help you troubleshoot live stream issues.</p>

<div class="BCL-taskSubsection"><!-- Steps subheading -->
<h3>View a live stream preview using the Live module</h3>
