        <p>In updating media sharing to work with the CMS API, we have also updated the feature generally to make it work better for you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shared videos will now use assets (renditions and text tracks) from the sharing account, so that changes to the assets (such as replacing or retranscoding the video) are automatically inherited by the shared videos.</li>
            <li>You can now directly manage sharing relationships without the help of Brightcove Support.</li>
            <li>Media sharing will work with Dynamic Delivery videos, even if Dynamic Delivery is not enabled for the account(s) you share to.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For details on using the new media sharing in Studio, see <a href="/node/15924">Sharing Videos to Other Accounts</a>.</p>
        <p>For details on using the new media sharing via the CMS API, see <a href="/node/18325">Media Sharing with the CMS API</a>.</p>
