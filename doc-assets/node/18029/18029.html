<h2>Limitations of this app</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The app updates all videos in the account with the same geo settings - it would be fairly simple to add options to select only a portion of the videos by requesting them by folder or some search criteria.</li>
	<li>There is no exception-handling - for a small account like the one used here, it doesn't matter much - if an API request times out, the app will fail at that point, and you can simply rerun it; for a large account, you would want to add some exception handling - at least keep track of <code>offset</code> variable, which keeps track of how many videos have been processed, so that you could restart the app at that point.</li>
	<li>For a large account, this would take some time to complete processing; any videos added after the app begins processing will be missed. The app tells you how many videos it processed, however, so you could get another count of videos afterwards to see if any were missed. The result are sorted by creation date ascending, so the missed videos will be the last ones added to account.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Obtain credentials</h2>

<p>Like most of Brightcove's RESTful APIs, the CMS API requires OAuth access tokens to authorize requests. In order to get access tokens, you first need to obtain client credentials with permissions for kinds of operations you want to request. This quick start makes API requests on a Brightcove Learning Services sample account, so you will not need to obtain credentials here, but you should understand what's happening. The CodePen sends the API request information to a proxy similar to <a href="/node/17925#php">this one</a>. The proxy accesses client credentials from a private location and uses them to generate a temporary access token using the <a href="/node/17928">OAuth API</a> and then makes the API request and returns the response data.</p>

<p>To try requests on your own account, get your client credentials and use one of our <a href="/node/17910">API testing tools</a>.</p>

<ol>
	<li>To obtain your credentials follow the instructions in <a href="/node/14056">Managing API Credentials</a>. This is the recommended way of obtaining your client credentials. In most cases, you will likely want to get all permissions:

	<figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Required Permissions</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>You can also obtain credentials using the OAuth API, following the instructions in one of the guides listed below. The following can be used with curl or Postman to get the proper permissions:</p>

<h2>CodePen</h2>

<p>The CodePen below contains the working app - you can run it to see what it does, and then look at the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code it uses.</p>

<h2>Proxy code</h2>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) You can download two versions of our proxy code:
<ul>
	<li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/bcls-proxy-for-distribution.php.zip">This is a general version that expects client credentials to be passed with the request</a></li>
	<li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/doc-samples-proxy.php.zip">This version allows you to save your client credentials in the proxy itself on lines 25-26 (recommended)</a></li>
</ul>
</aside>

<p>Below is the code for the proxy used with this sample. You can use it as is if you insert your <code>client_id</code> and <code>client_secret</code> values on lines 22-23, and deploy the file to a server where PHP is running. Or you can use this as a model for building a proxy in whatever language you like. If you are creating a server-side app, you can simply build the logic to get <a href="/node/17925">access tokens</a> into your app.</p>
