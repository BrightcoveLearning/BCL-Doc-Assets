<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="upload">Upload Settings</h2>

<p><strong>Default to Inactive</strong> - When checked, sets all uploaded videos to be inactive. This option is ignored if the user has access to the Media module. This could be used to let a set of users upload videos but they will remain inactive until someone else approves them and then makes them active.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced Upload</strong> - When checked, allows poster and thumbnail images to be uploaded when videos are uploaded using the Upload module. The upload status dialog will display and provide the ability to select poster and thumbnail images to upload. For more information, see <a href="/node/14456">Uploading Videos Using the Upload Module</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Default Image Dimensions</strong> - These values can be used to set default image sizes for poster and thumbnail images. By configuring sizes as part of the Upload Settings, you can avoid having to set image dimensions in your ingest profiles. When these values are configured and your ingest profiles have image sizes as well, Video Cloud will use the following process to determine what dimensions to use for various types of image ingests:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>When you upload a video using the Upload module, Video Cloud will first look to see if there are image dimensions defined in the selected ingest profile. If the ingest profile has image dimensions, those dimensions will be used. If not, Video Cloud will check for dimensions in the following order:
	<ul>
		<li>Use image dimensions specified in the default ingest profile for the account</li>
		<li>Use image dimensions specified in the Upload settings</li>
		<li>Use global default image dimensions specified by Video Cloud</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you upload a poster or thumbnail image from the video details page, or capture an image from the video details page, the image dimensions specified as part of the default ingest profile for the account will be used. If the default ingest profile does not have image dimensions, Video Cloud will check for dimensions in the following order:
	<ul>
		<li>Use image dimensions specified in the Upload settings</li>
		<li>Use global default image dimensions specified by Video Cloud</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to always use the image dimensions specified as part of the Upload Settings, Brightcove recommends you set these values appropriately and then remove all image sizing from your ingest profiles.</p>

<h2 id="analytics">Analytics Settings</h2>

<p>The Analytics Settings allow you to set the default reporting time zone for the account. The reporting time zone is used to calculate day boundaries for reporting data. Changing the reporting time zone setting only affects data going forward, and changes are not applied retroactively. If you change this setting, you may see a flat spot or a spike in your analytics data when looking at day boundaries where the change was applied. Updates to this setting may not take effect immediately and analytics data may continue to refer to the old setting until the system processes the changes.</p>
