<h2>Meaning</h2>

<p>We tried to upload the file to the specified address, but got a permission error. If this is a S3 URL, you probably need to <a href="/node/17890">grant read access to Zencoder</a> for this bucket or file. The easiest way to do this is to use a S3 client, like Amazon's AWS Console.</p>

<p>In technical speak, this means that we got a 403 Access Denied response from the server.</p>
