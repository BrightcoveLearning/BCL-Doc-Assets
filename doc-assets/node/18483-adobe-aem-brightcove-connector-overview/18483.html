    <p>The Adobe-AEM-Brightcove Connector allows you to manage Brightcove Video Cloud videos and players within AEM, and easily embed videos in AEM pages.</p>
    <p>The latest release of the connector can be found on <a href="https://github.com/coresecure/Adobe-AEM-Brightcove-Connector/releases">https://github.com/coresecure/Adobe-AEM-Brightcove-Connector/releases</a>.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Installation of the Connector is similar to installation of the v4.1/v4.2 Connector described  <a href="http://files.brightcove.com/bc-adobe-experience-manager.pdf">here</a> . If you are new to the Brightcove AEM Connector we recommend you read that document prior to proceeding.</p>
    <p>Because this version of the Connector has just been released, it is recommended to install the connector on a development server that is configured as similarly as possible to your production server and work with it enough to be sure that it meets your needs in terms of both functionality and stability before deploying it on a production server. Also, the Connector is open source and any usage of the Connector falls under this <a href="https://github.com/coresecure/Adobe-AEM-Brightcove-Connector/blob/master/LICENSE">License</a>.</p>
