	<li><strong><a href="ingestion_mrss.html">Ingesting from a Remotely Hosted MRSS Feed</a></strong><br />
	You can use Media RSS (MRSS) to have Ooyala pull your content from your own system from an MRSS feed that you publish. Backlot pulls the metadata from the MRSS feed and either creates a remote asset or downloads (from where they are hosted) and processes the videos and any associated files (thumbnails, closed caption files, etc.).</li>
