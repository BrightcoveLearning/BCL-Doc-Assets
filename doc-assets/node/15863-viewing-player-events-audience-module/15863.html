<div class="BCL-concept">
<p>The Audience module provides the ability to track view events. View events are sent to the Audience module every 10 seconds and when a video completes.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: View event data can be exported using the <a href="/node/15862">Export Data</a> option or by using the <a href="/node/18047">Audience API</a>.</p>

<p>To view the view events, open the Audience module and select <strong>View Activities (Events)</strong> in the left navigation.</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="http://img.brightcove.com/node15863-view-events.png" /></div>

<p>The page will display the following information.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Timestamp</strong> - Date and time of the video view</li>
	<li><strong>Video name and ID</strong> - Video name and Video Cloud video ID</li>
	<li><strong>Percent Watched</strong> - Total time watched / length of the video</li>
	<li><strong>Time Watched</strong> - Total time watched</li>
	<li><strong>External ID</strong> - Value used to identify the viewer, for example the Eloqua GUID, Marketo GUID, HubSpot GUID, SSO GUID or another unique value that was used to identify the viewer.</li>
	<li><strong>Status</strong> - Status of the event
	<ul>
		<li><strong>unprocessed</strong> - the event hasn't been synced to the marketing automation platform</li>
		<li><strong>synced</strong> - the event was successfully synced to the marketing automation platform</li>
		<li><strong>sync_disabled</strong> - Audience module was configured with sync disabled so the event was skipped</li>
		<li><strong>failed</strong> - error syncing; the tool tip provides some details about what error occurred</li>
		<li><strong>unknown_contact</strong> - unknown user so the event was not synced</li>
		<li><strong>N/A</strong> - not applicable; displayed when using Custom, Audience Tracking or Marketo munchkin integrations</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Event data can also be filtered by status using the dropdown list at the top of the page.</p>
