<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Dynamic Ingest API call is exactly the same as it would be for <a href="/node/17944">ingesting new videos</a> - the only difference is that you do not need to make a prior call to the CMS API to create the video object in the Video Cloud system and get an id for it. If the source video file at the specified URL is the same one originally ingested, you will simply get a new set of renditions. If the source file is new, you will be replacing the existing video. All videos will remain playable with existing renditions until retranscoding is complete.</p>

<h2>Implementation notes</h2>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Dynamic Ingest does <strong>not</strong> have a mechanism for processing multiple videos - this sample simply executes a loop to make a Dynamic Ingest request for each video.</aside>

<p>To get access tokens and make the API calls, it uses a proxy built by Brightcove Learning services.</p>

<section class="bcls-section" id="gettingCredentials">
<h2>Getting Credentials</h2>

<p>To get a <code>client_id</code> and <code>client_secret</code>, you will need to go to the OAuth UI and register this app:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://studio.brightcove.com/products/videocloud/admin/oauthsettings">https://studio.brightcove.com/products/videocloud/admin/oauthsettings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also get your credentials via CURL or Postman - see:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/node/17924">Get Client Credentials Using CURL</a></li>
	<li><a href="/node/17923">Get Client Credentials Using Postman</a></li>
</ul>

<section class="bcls-section" id="rateLimiting">
<h2>Rate limiting</h2>

<p>No more than 100 concurrent Dynamic Ingest jobs are allowed. The best way to avoid violating this rule is to create an app that receives notifications from the Dynamic Ingest system as well as submitting ingest requests, so that you can keep track of how many jobs are running and how many have completed - see <a href="/node/17941">Fallback / Retry Strategy</a>. This sample implements rudimentary rate limiting by pausing for 30 minutes after submitting 100 requests.</p>

<h2>Video data</h2>

<p>This script expects a data set as a JSON array of objects like this:</p>

<p>Video data:<textarea id="videoData" class="bcls-code">[
                    {
                        "name": "Woodpecker",
                        "id": "3931368189001",
                        "url": "http://learning-services-media.brightcove.com/videos/mp4/Bird_Woodpecker.mp4"
                    },
                    {

                        "id": "3931294493001",
                        "url": "http://learning-services-media.brightcove.com/videos/mp4/Bird_Chickadee.mp4"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Great Blue Heron",
                        "id": "3931294494001",
                        "url": "http://learning-services-media.brightcove.com/videos/mp4/greatblueheron.mp4"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Great Horned Owl",
                        "id": "3931368155001",
                        "url": "http://learning-services-media.brightcove.com/videos/mp4/greathornedowl.mp4"
                    }
                ]</textarea></p>

<p>This is the actual data used in this sample. You could include other metadata fields, but you would need to modify the script a little to send those with the first API call. You'll also notice that these are risky values to use for reference ids, especially for a sample like this that will be run multiple times - but I am getting around the duplication issue by appending the current epoch time in milliseconds to whatever is in the data.</p>

<h3>The JavaScript code for this sample:</h3>

<p>There are two parts to the JavaScript. Dynamic Ingest requests cannot be made from client-side JavaScript, so the in-page script just prepares the request and then sends it to a proxy implemented in PHP.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) You can download two versions of our proxy code:
<ul>
	<li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/bcls-proxy-for-distribution.php.zip">This is a general version that expects client credentials to be passed with the request</a></li>
	<li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/doc-samples-proxy.php.zip">This version allows you to save your client credentials in the proxy itself on lines 25-26 (recommended)</a></li>
