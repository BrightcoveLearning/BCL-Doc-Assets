<p>When you create a Brightcove player, a policy key is automatically generated for each player. This key is associated with your Brightcove account and controls which videos can be viewed and when they can be viewed, with the condition that the videos are stored in Video Cloud. For instance, policy keys are needed to limit access based on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Account</li>
	<li>Domain restrictions, if used</li>
	<li>Geo-restrictions, if used</li>
</ul>

<p>For a more detailed information on policy keys see the <a href="/node/18003">Overview: Policy API</a> document.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes:
<ul>
	<li>The policy key is only used to control videos that are stored in Video Cloud. If you are using the standalone Brightcove player, there is no need to access or retrieve the policy key.</li>
	<li>Policy keys generated for new Brightcove Players are not search enabled by default. You must set this manually using the Policy API. For details, see the <a href="/node/18003">Policy API Overview</a> document.</li>

<p>The policy key is automatically generated and managed for you. So, in most cases you will not need to request it or manage it. The easiest way to retrieve your policy key is to do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a Brightcove Player in Studio.</li>
	<li>Click on the URL link (either <strong>Preview</strong> or <strong>Published</strong> will work).</li>
	<li>In the browser address bar, change the <code>index.html</code> to <code>config.json</code>, and browse the new URL.</li>
	<li>In the displayed player configuration you will see the policy key as follows:</li>
</ol>

<p>In rare instances you may not have created a Brightcove Player, but still need your policy key (such as developing strictly with the Brightcove Native Player SDKs). In this case you will need to contact <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/en/contact">customer support</a> to get your policy key.</p>

<p>The policy key can be used to authenticate requests to the Playback API. The Playback API is for use at runtime in web pages or mobile apps for general media management and integration with other systems. For more details, see the <a href="/node/17906">Playback API</a> index page.</p>

<h2 id="Policy_keys_vs_API_credentials">Policy keys vs. API credentials</h2>

<p>The policy key is used to access the Playback API, whereas API credentials are used to access your content in the other Video Cloud API's.</p>

<h3>Policy keys</h3>

<p>The policy key is used for client-side retrieval of your Video Cloud library assets. Here are the details:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Access your video/playlist data using the Playback API</li>
	<li>Read-only</li>
	<li>Your video/playlist data is cached on the server by the Playback API</li>
	<li>Use the <a href="/node/18003">Policy API</a> to do the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Create policy keys. You need to contact customer support to revoke a policy key.</li>
		<li>Set domain restrictions and set geographic restrictions at the policy level. Restrictions are enforced by players that use the policy key.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">You can also use the <a href="/node/18108">Brightcove Player's catalog methods</a> to retrieve content from your Video Cloud library.</aside>

<h3>API credentials</h3>

<p>API authentication credentials (also called client credentials) allow server-side applications to manage your Video Cloud library assets. Here are the details:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/node/16824">Access your data using the Video Cloud APIs</a>. You will need client credentials for the account and API(s) that you wish to use.</li>
	<li>Read, insert, update, delete</li>
	<li>Your video/playlist data is not cached on the server by the CMS API</li>
	<li>Use <a href="/node/14056">Video Cloud's API Authentication UI</a> to create and manage API credentials</li>
</ul>
