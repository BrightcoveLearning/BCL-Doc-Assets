    <p>Video player publishing allows the user to easily insert videos from their Brightcove account onto their WordPress site.</p>

    <p>To post a video, start by simply navigating to the new post page. At core functionality, there is an "Add Media" button below the title and above the editor. With Brightcove Video Connect, there is also a "Brightcove Media" button. Click on that to open the Brightcove media modal.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>From there, the user can select the image they would like to use by clicking on it. The video's thumbnail will appear on the side, along with options. To find a specific video, you can search by title, tag, or description.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>The user can then choose what player they want to use and customize options such as autoplay, embed style, and sizing.</p>

    <p>There are two options for inserting the video. Simply clicking The "Insert into Post" button will insert the video into the post, but the user can also copy the shortcode and paste it into the post. If you use the "Insert into Post" button, the short code will still be visible in the plain text view.</p>

    <p>The video will appear on the new post page, but to see what it will look like published, check the post preview. It may be very different.</p>

      <p>Playlists can be published in exactly the same way as single videos. Note that there must be a playlist-enabled Brightcove player in order to publish playlists.</p>

    <p>The user can upload videos to Brightcove and update metadata straight from their WordPress dashboard.</p>

    <section class="bcls-subsection">
      <h3 id="video_upload">Video Upload</h3>

      <p>To upload a video to Brightcove, from the Brightcove admin page on WordPress, click "Add New."</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/add-new.png" alt="The add new button.">
      </figure>

      <p>From there you can select a file or drag a file to the page to upload. You may select multiple filed to upload at a single time</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/drop-files.png" alt="Select or drag and drop." width="800px">
      </figure>

      <p>The file will appear on the page. To add metadata, click on the name of the file and the option will open.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/upload-with-metadata.png". alt="Add metadata." width="800px">
      </figure>

      <p>When you are ready, hit start upload.</p>

      <p>Videos can be uploaded in the same way from the media modal on the new post page by clicking the "Upload" link.</p>

      <h3 id="failure">Failure</h3>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/unable-to-upload.png" alt="failure notice">
      </figure>

      <p>If the video fails to upload, it could be a problem with file permissions. Check to make sure the web server has read/write permissions for the wp-content/uploads folder. The video will be temporarily uploaded here.</p>

      <p>Brightcove also will not ingest from behind a firewall. If that is the problem, the new video will be generated, but not transcoded.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/failed-upload.png" alt="failed upload">
      </figure>

      <p>As a work around, go to your Brightcove account and replace the source file. The firewall must be opened for Brightcove to ingest video from WordPress.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/replace-source.png" alt="replace source">
      </figure>

      <p>Don't forget to uncheck the box for keeping existing thumbnail and poster. Otherwise it will remain a grey box.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>After it's finished uploading, your video should be available in WordPress.</p>

      <h3 id="metadata">Metadata</h3>
      <p>From WordPress, a user can update a video's name, short description, long description, and tags.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">

      <p>New thumbnails, posters, and caption tracks can be uploaded too, but as with uploading videos, you may be blocked by firewalls or permissions.</p>

      <p>Other metadata fields, including custom fields, must be edited in Brightcove Studio.</p>

      <p>Players can also only be created or edited in Brightcove Studio, but some aspects, such as size, can be changed for the specific video when it is being published. Please be advised that a playlist player must exist already before you can publish playlists.</p>
