    <p>Video player publishing allows the user to easily insert videos from their Brightcove account onto their Wordpress site.</p>

    <p>To post a video, start by simply navigating to the new post page and click the Brightcove icon.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>From there, the user can select the image they would like to use by clicking on it. The image will appear on the side, along with options. To find a specific video, you can search by title, tag, or description.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>The user can then choose what player they want to use and customize options such as autoplay, embed style, and sizing.</p>

    <p>There are two options for inserting the video. Simply clicking The "Insert into Post" button will insert the video into the post, but the user can also copy the shortcode and paste it into the post.</p>

    <p>The video will appear on the new post page, but to see what it will look like published, check the post preview. It may be very different.</p>

      <p>Playlists can be published in exactly the same way as single videos. Note, though, that you will have to have a playlist player already made in order to publish a playlist.</p>

    <p>The user can upload videos to Brightcove and update metadata straight from their Wordpress dashboard.</p>

    <section class="bcls-subsection">
      <h3 id="video_upload">Video Upload</h3>

      <p>To upload a video to Brightcove, from the Brightcove admin page on Wordpress, click "Add New."</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/add-new.png" alt="The add new button." width="800px">
      </figure>

      <p>From there you can select a file or drag a file to the page to upload.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/drop-files.png" alt="Select or drag and drop." width="800px">
      </figure>

      <p>The file will appear on the page. To add metadata, click on the name of the file and the option will open.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/upload-with-metadata.png" alt="Add metadata." width="800px">
      </figure>

      <p>When you are ready, hit start upload.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="bcls-subsection">
      <h3 id="failure">Failure</h3>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/unable-to-upload.png" alt="failure notice">
      </figure>

      <p>If the video fails to upload, there are a few possible explanations.</p>

      <p>If nothing will load, it could be a problem with file permissions. This can be fixed with your file manager, or from the command line.</p>

      <p>To fix on command line run <code>chown -R www-data path/to/file</code> followed by <code>chmod -R 755 path/to/file</code> </p>

      <p>Brightcove also will not upload from behind a firewall. If that is the problem, the new video will be generated, but not transcoded.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/failed-upload.png" alt="failed upload">
      </figure>

      <p>To fix this, go to your Brightcove account and replace the source file.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/replace-source.png" alt="replace source">
      </figure>

      <p>Don't forget to uncheck the box for keeping existing thumbnail and poster. Otherwise it will remain a grey box.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/keep-thumbnails.png" alt="box unchecked so new thumbnails are generated">
      </figure>

      <p>After it's finished uploading, your video should be available in Wordpress just like all the rest!</p>

    </section>

    <section class="bcls-subsection">
      <h3 id="metadata">Metadata</h3>
      <p>From Wordpress, a user can update a video's name, short description, long description, and tags.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/edit-screen.png" alt="edit screen with new name and information" width="800px">
      </figure>

      <p>New thumbnails, posters, and caption tracks can be uploaded too, but as with uploading videos, you may be blocked by firewalls or permissions.</p>

      <p>Other metadata fields, including custom fields, must be edited on the Brightcove site.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="bcls-subsection">
      <h3 id="playlist_management">Playlist Management</h3>
      <p>Playlists cannot be created from Wordpress, but once they exist, they can be edited. Videos can be added or removed, or moved up or down in the list.</p>

      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/node/18582-wordpress-brightcove-connector-using-the-connector/playlist.png" alt="edit playlist screen" width="800px">
      </figure>

    </section>

    <section class="bcls-subsection">
      <h3 id="players">Players</h3>
      <p>Players can also only be created or edited on the Brightcove site, but some aspects, such as size, can be changed for the specific video when it is being published. Please be advised that a playlist player must exist already before you can publish playlists.</p>
