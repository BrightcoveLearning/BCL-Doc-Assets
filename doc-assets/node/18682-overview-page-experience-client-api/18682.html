    <p>The In-Page Experiences Client API is a JavaScript library that helps you manage the behavior of the In-Page Experience at runtime, similar to the way the Brightcove Player API is used to control the behavior of the player. The API is available on any page that runs one or more Brightcove embedded experiences. It is designed to help 3rd parties with Brightcove experiences integration. Provides access to current player, videos and state information as well as listeners for playback-related events.</p>
    <p>See the full <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/in-page-exerience-client-api/ClientApi.html">API reference</a> for details of the available methods and events.</p>
