  <p>The Adobe-AEM-Brightcove Connector allows you to manage Brightcove Video Cloud videos and players within AEM, and easily embed videos in AEM pages.</p>
  <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that this guide uses AEM 6.3. The connector also works with AEM 6.2, and the steps are similar.</aside>
  <p>The Brightcove AEM Connector consists of following components: <a href="video_player_publishing">video player publishing</a>, <a href="video_content_management">video content management</a>, and an <a href="administrative_page">administrative page</a>.</p>

  <p>Video player publishing allows the user to drag a Brightcove player component onto a web page and then select the Brightcove account, video, and player for that component. This component was available in the v4.2 Connector in Classic UI mode only. In the v5.1 Connector, this component is available in both Classic UI mode and Touch UI mode. Another change from v4.2 is the legacy Smartplayer components are no longer available; only the HTML5 Brightcove player components are available now. Existing web pages with the legacy SmartPlayer components may still contain those components, but new legacy SmartPlayer components cannot be added to a web page.</p>
