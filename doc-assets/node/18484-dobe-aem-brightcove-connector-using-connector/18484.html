  <p>The Adobe-AEM-Brightcove Connector allows you to manage Brightcove Video Cloud videos and players within AEM, and easily embed videos in AEM pages.</p>
  <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that this guide uses AEM 6.3. The connector also works with AEM 6.2, and the steps are similar.</aside>
  <p>The Brightcove AEM Connector consists of following components: <a href="video_player_publishing">video player publishing</a>, <a href="video_content_management">video content management</a>, and an <a href="administrative_page">administrative page</a>.</p>

  <p>Video player publishing allows the user to drag a Brightcove player component onto a web page and then select the Brightcove account, video, and player for that component. This component was available in the v4.2 Connector in Classic UI mode only. In the v5.1 Connector, this component is available in both Classic UI mode and Touch UI mode. Another change from v4.2 is the legacy Smartplayer components are no longer available; only the HTML5 Brightcove player components are available now. Existing web pages with the legacy SmartPlayer components may still contain those components, but new legacy SmartPlayer components cannot be added to a web page.</p>

  <h3>Video Synchronization</h3>
  <p>Video content management in the v5.1 Connector uses the AEM DAM to uploaded videos to Brightcove and update metadata in Brightcove.  In previous versions of the connector the administrative page at /brightcove/admin was used for this purpose.</p>
  <p>If new videos are being uploaded directly to Brightcove and/or if metadata is being edited directly in Brightcove, with Brightcove Studio for instance, the <strong>SYNC DATABASE</strong> button on the Brightcove administration page at http://localhost:4502/brightcove/admin will synchronize new videos or updated metadata from Brightcove into the AEM DAM.  This database sync can be setup to execute on a schedule as well.  Note that video assets imported from Brightcove into the DAM will not copy the original video into the AEM DAM but instead will use the Brightcove thumbnail as a placeholder for the asset.  Thus, the AEM database size will not grow substantially when importing videos from Brightcove.</p>
  <p>New videos can also be uploaded to the AEM DAM directly and then they will be synchronized to Brightcove during the Publish operation in AEM.  When a video is uploaded to the AEM DAM and then synchronized with Brightcove, that original video file is stored in the AEM DAM.  For some implementations it is preferred to keep the “master” video in the AEM database while for other implementations it is not preferred because the size of the AEM database will grow too quickly.  If you do not want the original video stored in the AEM DAM, you can simply delete the video in the AEM DAM after it has been synchronized to Brightcove and it will be imported from Brightcove with the thumbnail image placeholder during the next synchronization, triggered by the <strong>SYNC DATABASE</strong> button on the Brightcove administrative page.</p>
  <h3>Video Content Management</h3>
  <p>The Connector uses the AEM DAM to upload new videos to Brightcove and synchronize metadata changes to Brightcove.</p>
  <h4>Setup</h4>
  <p>Before using the AEM DAM with Brightcove for the first time, the DAM Integration Path folder structure as specified on the Brightcove configuration page at http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr needs to be created. The default is http://localhost:4502/content/dam/brightcove_assets if you do not change it on the configuration page.</p>
  <p>In Classic UI the folders can be created at http://localhost:4502/damadmin#/content/dam. In Touch UI the folders are created at http://localhost:4502/assets.html/content/dam. Alternatively, the “SYNC DATABASE” button on the administrative page at http://localhost:4502/brightcove/admin will create the necessary folders in the AEM DAM and import any videos that already exist in the Brightcove account. If you do not want to sync some or all videos in Brightcove, those videos with the tag AEM_NO_DAM will not be synced into the AEM DAM.</p>
  <p>Also, if you are using the AEM DAM in Classic UI, enable the Title field as shown below when viewing http://localhost:4502/damadmin#/content/dam:</p>
