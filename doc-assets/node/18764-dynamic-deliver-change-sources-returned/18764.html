    <h2 id="">Notice: change to sources</h2>
    <p>During March, 2019, Brightcove is updating the infrastructure for Dynamic Delivery to make a small change in the sources that are returned by the CMS/Playback APIs, and therefore delivered to the Brightcove Player and native SDK players.</p>
    <p>For the great majority of Video Cloud users, this change is completely transparent. There is nothing you need to do. For a few customers who have built integrations relying on the exact structure of the existing sources, these integrations will need to change.</p>
