    <h2 id="terms">Understanding codecs, containers, and file extensions</h2>

    <p>Codecs, containers and file extensions are not equivalent but are often confused with one another. For example, H.264 video does not just mean a file with the extension <span style="font-family: Courier New;">.mp4</span>. Video files contain both metadata (duration, dimensions, etc.) as well as the encoded and often compressed audio and video data.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The <em>container</em> format defines how the metadata is stored along with the audio and video data. It does not define the coding or compression of the data.</li>
        <li><em>Codecs</em> are responsible for encoding and decoding the video and audio streams in a video file. They can be lossy or lossless and are usually optimized for certain types of transmission. Note that there are some cases where the codec and container share a single definition, but these are uncommon.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other terms that are often confused are encoding/decoding and muxing/demuxing.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><em>Encoding </em>and <em>decoding </em>refer to converting the encoded video and audio data to and from streams that can be played.</li>
        <li><em>Muxing </em>and <em>demuxing </em>refers to the writing and reading of audio and video streams into and from various container formats.</li>
    </ul>
