    <h2 id="terms">Understanding codecs, containers, and file extensions</h2>

    <p>Codecs, containers and file extensions are not equivalent but are often confused with one another. For example, H.264 video does not just mean a file with the extension <span style="font-family: Courier New;">.mp4</span>. Video files contain both metadata (duration, dimensions, etc.) as well as the encoded and often compressed audio and video data.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The <em>container</em> format defines how the metadata is stored along with the audio and video data. It does not define the coding or compression of the data.</li>
        <li><em>Codecs</em> are responsible for encoding and decoding the video and audio streams in a video file. They can be lossy or lossless and are usually optimized for certain types of transmission. Note that there are some cases where the codec and container share a single definition, but these are uncommon.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other terms that are often confused are encoding/decoding and muxing/demuxing.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><em>Encoding </em>and <em>decoding </em>refer to converting the encoded video and audio data to and from streams that can be played.</li>
        <li><em>Muxing </em>and <em>demuxing </em>refers to the writing and reading of audio and video streams into and from various container formats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="supported_source_formats">Supported source video types</h2>
    <p>Since Brightcove generally handles the complexity of creating renditions with codecs and formats appropriate to different platforms, browsers, and device apps, what concerns you most is what kinds of source videos we can trancode for you.</p>
    <p>Since Brightcove supports so many video input types, it is actually  more helpful to talk about the formats we do not support. At the moment, there are only a few. The list below shows the formats <strong><em>not</em></strong> supported for <a href="/node/">Zencoder</a>, the Video Cloud <a href="/node/">Upload module</a> and <a href="/node/">Dynamic Ingest API</a>, and the <a href="/node/17768">Once Ingest API</a>.</p>

    	<ul>
    		<li>Apple Intermediate</li>
    		<li>HDV 720p60</li>
    		<li>Go2Meeting3 (G2M3)</li>
    		<li>Avid Meridien Uncompressed</li>
            <li>CineForm - partly supported; there are variants that can come from the software used to encode the source, or from OS, that make the source unusuable by Zencoder. We are still trying to identify the exact factors that cause problems.</li>
    	</ul>

    	<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: AVdh (DNxHQ) also does not work for <strong>422 10-bit and 444 12-bit sources (only)</strong> - this is a bug, and this note will be removed when it is fixed.</aside>
