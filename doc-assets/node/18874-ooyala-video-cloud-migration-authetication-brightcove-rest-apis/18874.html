    <p>Most of the Brightcove REST APIs use OAuth2 as the basis for authentication, and we'll look at the OAuth implementation in more detail in the sections that follow.</p>
    <p>First, however, note that three APIs use different approaches to authentication:</p>
    <section class="bcls-subsection">
      <h3 id="policy_key">Policy key authentication</h3>
      <p>The <a href="/node/18380">Playback API</a> used mainly to retrieve video and playlist data from players or web portals, uses a <code>policy_key</code>, for authentication, usually passed as an argument in an <code>Accept</code> header:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-http">Accept: application/json;pk={policy_key}</code></pre>
      <p>Policy keys are generated automatically for Brightcove players, and may be taken from a <a href="">player configuration</a></p>
