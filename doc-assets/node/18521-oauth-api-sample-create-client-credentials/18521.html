<p>Getting client credentials is a one-time prerequisite for getting access tokens, which the majority of Brightcove APIs use ato authenticate requests.</p>

<p>For a full explanation of client credentials, see <a href="/node/17928">how the Brightcove OAuth service works</a>.</p>

<p>This sample shows you how to get client credentials from a web app. Because the OAuth API is not CORS-enabled and requests must be made from the server side, the app sends necessary information to a proxy, which then makes the api request and sends the response back to the client. The proxy here is written in PHP, but any server-side language will do - you just need to be able to send a POST request to the app over the internet.</p>

<div class="bcls-expander-content">
<p>To get a <code>client_id</code> and <code>client_secret</code> via the OAuth API, you will need a <code>BC_TOKEN</code> to authenticate your request. Your BC_TOKEN is set as a cookie when you login to Studio. You can get that cookie any way you like, but to make it easier, we have created the following JavaScript snippet - you can paste it into the developer console when you are logged into Studio, press <strong>return</strong>, and a prompt will appear containing the BC_TOKEN:</p>
<textarea class="bcls-code">var cookiesArray = document.cookie.split(";"), cookiesObj = {}, i, tmpArray = [];
for (i = 0; i &lt; cookiesArray.length; i++) {
    tmpArray = cookiesArray[i].split("=");
    if (tmpArray[0].indexOf('BC_TOKEN') &gt; -1) {
        cookiesObj.BC_TOKEN = tmpArray[1];
    }
}
window.prompt("BC_TOKEN:", cookiesObj.BC_TOKEN);</textarea>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that you must be an admin for your account (or get an admin's BC_TOKEN) in order to create client credentials. If you do not have an admin BC_TOKEN, the request below will return an error.</aside>
