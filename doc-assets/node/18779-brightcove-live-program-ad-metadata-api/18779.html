    <p>The ad metadata (ad_server_data) schema supports a flat JSON syntax without nested elements (key-value pairs only). Ad server data set via the API is used for all ad breaks received after updating until the data is overwritten or reset. Customers can update and/or reset the data at any time during their live stream.</p>
    <p> This metadata does not persist between steam activations. Ad metadata that needs to persist between stream activations should be set on the SSAI application ad configuration. Data set via the API is configurable for use as macros on ad server and server-side beacon replacement.</p>
