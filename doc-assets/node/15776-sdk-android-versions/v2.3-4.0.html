<p class="BCL-objective">The Brightcove Player SDK for Android will be removing support for versions 2.3 and 4.0 as of January 1st, 2016. Google continuously releases content updates to Android which affect the technology that the Brightcove SDK works with. In order to focus on cutting edge features we must evolve alongside Google by providing support only for relevant versions of Android.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>Support is defined in terms of the major.minor.revision of an OS (for example: Android 2.3.3). Only the latest revision of a version is supported. Customers can still use the Brightcove SDK for Android on unsupported versions, however we provide no guarantee of functionality.</p>

<h3 class="BCL_subsectionTitle">Google Play Store</h3>

<p>Google’s Play Store provides usage data that shows which Android versions have logged into the Play Store for a highlighted week. As of November 2nd 2015, data shows that 92.7% of devices connected to the Play Store are running Android 4.1 or higher. Setting the drop date for January gives us several more months for that remaining 7.3% to decrease. Typically, the holidays see a dramatic increase in more modern versions as people upgrade their devices. Current Play Store data can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/intl/es/about/dashboards/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="BCL_subsectionTitle">Brightcove SDK for Android Streams</h3>

<p>In addition to examining the Play Store data we can also review traffic that the Brightcove SDK is seeing across the different Android versions. This is much more relevant data as it gives us an idea of where video is actually being watched.</p>

<figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Video views measured from a sample mid-August 2015</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The above chart shows a movement towards recent Android versions as 98% of Brightcove video views are coming from Android 4.1+; Android 2.3 doesn’t even appear on the scale. This data complements the Play Store analysis and shows that even though there are still a few 2.3 and 4.0 devices out there, they aren’t being used to watch content through our SDKs.</p>

<section id="The_cost_of_supporting_older_Android_versions" class="bcls-section">
<h2>The cost of supporting older Android versions</h2>

<p>Committing to older versions comes with heavy maintenance and upkeep costs which outweigh the benefits of supporting a minute fraction of the market. The following are a few considerations that the team faces supporting older versions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bug fixes released in newer versions of Android still need to be accounted for in older versions of our SDK.</li>
	<li>Features released in newer versions of Android enable us to create functionality we could not otherwise easily build. This forces us to forgo taking advantage of new features in Android, or to spend the time building up feature parity within the SDK for older versions.</li>
	<li>Partners often focus on supporting more recent versions which causes issues for customers expecting integrations to work on older devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>End of life schedule</h2>

<p>In preparation for this transition we will be marking Android 2.3.x and 4.0 as deprecated on our documentation sites and in the project changelog. As of January 1st 2016 we will remove these versions from our supported devices list.</p>
