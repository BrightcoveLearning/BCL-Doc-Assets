	<p>After June 30th, 2018, the Brightcove Native Player SDK for Android is deprecating support for Android OS versions 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. In order to focus on cutting edge features, we must evolve alongside Google by providing support only for relevant versions of Android.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brightcove-native-player-sdks">SDK Developer Forums</a>!</p>

<p>
Support is defined in terms of the major.minor.revision of an OS (for example: Android 4.4.4). Only the latest revision of a version is supported. Customers can still use the Brightcove SDK for Android on unsupported versions, however we provide no guarantee of functionality.

<h3>Google Play Store</h3>
<p>
Google’s Play Store provides usage data for Android versions which have logged into the Play Store for a highlighted week. As of May 7th 2018, data shows that Android 4.1.X, 4.2.X, and 4.3.X account for 1.5%, 2.2% and 0.6% of total Android use respectively.

<p>
Current Play Store data can be found in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/">Android Distribution dashboard</a>.

<h3>Brightcove Native Player SDK for Android</h3>
<p>
In addition to examining the Play Store data, we can also review traffic that the Brightcove SDK is seeing across the different Android versions. This gives us an idea of who is actually watching video on their devices.

<p>
Our data is consistent with the graph from Google’s Play Store. We see in our chart above that Android 4.1 accounts for ~1% of total traffic, Android 4.2 ~2% and Android 4.3 is ~0%.
