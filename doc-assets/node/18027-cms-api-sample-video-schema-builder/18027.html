<p>You can generate the code here and use it as your publishing code if you are using a single Brightcove player for the account and a standard (iframe) embed. If you are using another player or the advanced (in-page) embed, you can just use the schema part of the generated code and insert it above your player embed code in the page.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
<p>This is a client-side app, and and therefore makes requests to the CMS API from the client-side. However, you cannot simply use this script in pages with your players to generate effective schemas, because the schema code must be injected into the page on the server side, before the page is delivered to the browser, to be recognized by search engines. If you are serving your pages via a web server application, use the logic here to get the information using the <a href="/node/18034">CMS API</a> and embed it in the page before it is served. The schemas generated by this app have to hard-coded into the player page.</p>

<p>Also note that this app produces code for a single video player only, and if you are embedding the schema code manually, you should update it periodically, as URLs can change</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) You can download two versions of our proxy code:
<ul>
	<li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/bcls-proxy-for-distribution.php.zip">This is a general version that expects client credentials to be passed with the request</a></li>
	<li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/doc-samples-proxy.php.zip">This version allows you to save your client credentials in the proxy itself on lines 25-26 (recommended)</a></li>
</ul>
