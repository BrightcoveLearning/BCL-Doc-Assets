<p>At Brightcove, we strive to keep the documentation structured, clean and intuitive. As such, we leverage github READMEs for details on all our plugins and integrations. For your convenience, we've listed and linked to these plugins below.</p>
<!--                <p class="warning">Note: versions of the SDK prior to version 4.0 are <strong>no longer supported by Brightcove</strong> - please update your apps to use the latest version of the SDK.</p>-->

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is required in your project. This is the current default for Xcode projects.</li>
	<li>With the release of iOS 9 and Xcode 7, a new feature called App Transport Security (ATS) was introduced. Learn more about <a href="/node/18215">Working with App Transport Security</a>.</li>

<h2 id="Supported_versions">Supported versions</h2>

<p>In order to take advantage of the latest technology improvements from Apple, we offer two levels of support:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Active</strong>: Brightcove will test and fix bugs on these OS versions.</li>
	<li><strong>Passive</strong>: Brightcove will test on these OS versions, but bug fixes will be handled on a case by case basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, Brightcove provides active support for the versions of the OS that are used by 80% of the user base, and passive support for other versions used by at least 5% of the user base.</p>

<h3>Active support</h3>

<p>Brightcove provides active support for the latest iOS SDK on the following iOS versions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>iOS 11</li>
	<li>iOS 10</li>
</ul>

<h3>Passive support</h3>

<p>Brightcove provides passive support for the following iOS versions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>iOS 9</li>
	<!-- <li>iOS 8</li> -->
</ul>
<!-- <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">As of January 1 2018, the Brightcove SDK for iOS will be <a href="/node/18491">removing support for iOS 8</a>.</aside> --></section>

<p>The following table contains links to get plugins integrated with your SDK implementation. The plugins can be downloaded from their respective Github Repos, and each repo contains a detailed README with instructions on how to setup the plugin.</p>

<p>The sample applications demonstrate the basic functionality of each plugin integrated with the SDK. These sample apps are a good way to learn about each plugin, and serve as a reference point when debugging.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">The current release of the Native SDK for iOS includes all components with the same version number.

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
<p>The following notes refer to the integrations in the table above.</p>

<p id="n1"><sup>[1]</sup> The current version of the IMA plugin supports Google's IMA iOS SDK v3, which supports iOS versions 8.0+. For details, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/ios/">Google's documentation</a>.</p>

<p id="n2"><sup>[2]</sup> If you are using Swift, you must manually add Google's IMA libraries, instead of using CocoaPods. This is because Google's IMA library does not support dynamic frameworks, and Swift does not support building static libraries. For details, see the <strong>Manual</strong> section of the <a href="https://github.com/brightcove/brightcove-player-sdk-ios-ima#manual">IMA Plugin for Brightcove Player SDK for iOS</a> documentation. Even though Brightcove's IMA plugin uses a dynamic framework, the Google IMA library is only provided as a static framework.</p>
<!-- <p id="n3"><sup>[3]</sup> The current version of the Sidecar Subtitles plugin does not support WebVTT for remote assets. If you are using remote assets, you may want to use in-manifest captions.</p> -->

<p id="n3"><sup>[3]</sup> The Sidecar Subtitles plugin supports playback over AirPlay with captions.</p>

<p id="n4"><sup>[4]</sup> For details about keeping your subtitles in sync, see the <a href="/node/18216">Synchronizing WebVTT Captions</a> document.</p>

<p id="n5"><sup>[5]</sup> A known Apple issue is that FairPlay streaming content will not be rendered in AirPlay Mirroring mode. For more details, see the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/502/">WWDC presentation: Content Protection for HLS</a> (scroll about halfway through the transcript).</p>

<p id="n6"><sup>[6]</sup> The Brightcove Native SDKs have deprecated support for the Widevine Classic integration. For details, see the following <a href="/node/16613">announcement</a>.</p>

<p id="n7"><sup>[7]</sup> The current version of the Native SDK for iOS has the Brightcove player controls built into it, so you no longer have to use this plugin.</p>
</aside>

<h3>Combining plugins</h3>

<p>With the Native SDK for iOS, the <code>BCOVSessionProviders</code> from each plugin are created and chained together. This chain is then used to create the <code>BCOVPlaybackController</code>. For details, see the <a href="https://github.com/brightcove/brightcove-player-sdk-ios#combining-plugins">Combining Plugins section</a> of the SDK Reference.</p>

<h3>Advertising</h3>

<p>Here is additional information you may find helpful when working with the Advertising plugins.</p>

<h4>IMA plugin</h4>

<p>The placement of VAST ads is typically specified by a VMAP document. VAST describes an ad while VMAP describes the placement of ads in a video. For code details, see the <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/ios-player-samples/tree/master/IMA">BasicIMAPlayer iOS</a> sample.</p>

<p>When working with IMA ads, it is best practice to check that your ads work outside of the SDK before implementing them. The following links will be helpful for this:</p>
