<h2 class="bcls-expander-head">Development sequence</h2>

<div class="bcls-expander-content">
<p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
	<li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
	<li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
	<li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
	<li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
</ol>

<p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/node/18081">Quick Start to Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>

<h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>

<p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
	<li>Automatically responsive</li>
	<li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
</ul>

<p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
	<li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
	<li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

<section id="selectimplementation" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Select implementation</h2>

<p>This sample uses the In-Page embed code. You can also move the CSS and JavaScript into a plugin, which is recommended.</p>
</section>

<section id="resources" class="bcls-section">
<h2>API resources used</h2>

<p>The following sections detail resources used from various APIs.</p>

<h3>Brightcove player API methods</h3>

<ul>
	<li><code>catalog.getVideo()</code></li>
	<li><code>playlist()</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>APIs</h3>

<p>This sample uses the Analytics API via a <a href="#proxy">proxy</a> built in PHP.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="player">The player</h2>

<p>The player is embedded in the JSFiddle below - select the <strong>Results</strong> tab to see the working sample. The playlist will appear automatically as soon as the video data is retrieved. The request to the Analytics API to get the 6 most viewed videos in the past 24 hours is shown, along with the API response.</p>

<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/Brightcove_Learning/t81btm52/embed/js,html,css,result/dark/"></script>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="code">How it works</h2>

<p>The following sections explain the player, JavaScript and CSS code used in the example. The code is all contained in the JSFiddle, except for the proxy used to make the Analytics API request. The proxy is required to get an access token used to authenticate the request. The code for the proxy is shown <a href="#proxy">below</a>.</p>

<h3>Create the player</h3>

<p>The player has no special attributes except that the width is set to 600px and playlist display is enabled. To create a player and assign a video to it, follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>In the <strong>Players</strong> module, create a new player or use an existing one.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> and then <strong>Publish</strong> the player.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Media</strong> module, select <strong>an empty playlist</strong> and publish it with this player.</li>
	<li>Copy the <strong>In-Page</strong> embed code and paste it into an empty <code>div</code> tag in a new HTML file. The div tag is needed for styling purposes, to position the playlist correctly.</li>
</ol>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">For details on how to get this embed code, see the <a href="/node/18209">Quick Start to Brightcove Player</a> document.</aside>

<h3 id="JSCode">The JavaScript code</h3>

<p>All of the JavaScript is contained in the JSFiddle. Because the sequence of processing is fairly complex, there in an <code>init()</code> function that acts as kind of controller for the rest of the script.</p>

<p>Here is the basic logic:</p>

<figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="script logic" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playlists/sample-popular-videos-playlist/popular-video-playlist.png" /></figure>

<h3 id="CSSCode">The stylesheet</h3>

<p>This example uses CSS styles to override some of the CSS for player and playlist. The CSS is in the CodePen, but there is some additional CSS just for the JSFiddle itself. The rules that are essential using this playlist are:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-css">/* override player styles */
video {
    position: relative;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
}
/* override playlist styles */
.vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist {
    font-size: 1rem;
    position: absolute;
    top: 63px;
    left: 516px;
    width: 250px;
    max-width: 270px;
    min-width: 200px;
    max-height: 264px;
}</code></pre>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="proxy">Proxy code</h2>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) You can download two versions of our proxy code:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/bcls-proxy-for-distribution.php.zip">This is a general version that expects client credentials to be passed with the request</a></li>
        <li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/doc-samples-proxy.php.zip">This version allows you to save your client credentials in the proxy itself on lines 25-26 (recommended)</a></li>
