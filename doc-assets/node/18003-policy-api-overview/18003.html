<h2>Do you need one?</h2>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Policy keys are generated for Brightcove Players automatically when you create them. You only need to generate policy keys directly using this API if you wish to get a key with geo-restrictions for a player, or to access the Playback API without creating a player - typically this would be for apps created using the <a href="/node/10104">device SDKs</a>. See <a href="/node/18125">Policy Keys</a> for instructions on how to obtain the policy key for any Brightcove Player.</aside>

<section class="bcls-section" id="faq">
<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>Here are some questions about the Policy API that we commonly get.</p>

<dl>
	<dt class="bcls-question">Can policy keys be created for multiple accounts, or only one?</dt>
	<dd class="bcls-answer">Policy keys allow access to videos and playlist for one account. If you have multiple accounts, you need to create policy keys for each one.</dd>
	<dt class="bcls-question">Do policy keys expire?</dt>
	<dd class="bcls-answer">No, policy keys are good forever. If you need to revoke a policy key, you must contact <a href="//support.brightcove.com/en/contact">Brightcove Support</a> - include the account id and the policy key you wish to revoke in the request.</dd>
	<dt class="bcls-question">Will policy keys work for all users on the account?</dt>
	<dd class="bcls-answer">Yes, anyone who has the policy key can use it.</dd>
</dl>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section" id="baseURL">
<h2>Base URL</h2>

<p>The base URL for the Policy API is:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-http">https://policy.api.brightcove.com/v1</code></pre>

<h3>Account path</h3>

<p>In all cases, requests will be made for a specific Video Cloud Account. So, you will always add <code>/accounts/</code> followed by your account id to the base URL:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-http">https://policy.api.brightcove.com/v1<strong>/accounts/{account_id}</strong></code></pre>
</section>

<section id="authenticaion" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>Requests are authenticated by a access token passed in an <code>Authorization</code> header:</p>

<pre>
<code>Authorization: Bearer {access_token}</code></pre>

<p>To get access tokens, you will need to have client credentials for the account that have permissions for <code>video-cloud/player/all</code> operations. You can obtain your client credentials (a <code>client_id</code> and <code>client_secret</code>) through <a href="/node/14056">Studio (recommended)</a> or directly via the <a href="/node/17928">Brightcove OAuth API</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have client credentials, you can <a href="/node/17925">obtain temporary access tokens from the OAuth API</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section" id="createPolicy">
<h2>Create a policy key</h2>

<p>To create a new policy key, make a POST request to:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-http">https://policy.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{account_id}/policy_keys</code></pre>

<h3>Request body (concise format)</h3>

<p>In the request body, include the JSON for the policy - this is the concise format (see the full format below):</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "key-data": {
        "account-id": "{account_id}"
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>This is the most basic policy, which restricts access to the account, you must include this in any policy you create. The account id here must match the account id in the request URL, or an error will be returned.</p>
</section>

<section id="domain-restriction" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Domain restriction</h2>

<p>In addition to limiting access to the account, you can also limit access to specific domains by adding the <code>allowed-domains</code> key:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "key-data": {
        "account-id": "123456789001",
        "allowed-domains": [
            "http://www.abc.com",
            "https://www.abc.com",
            "http://www.xyz.com",
            "https://www.xyz.com"
        ]
    }
}</code></pre>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">
<ul>
	<li>Domains must contain the protocol and domain name, and the port, unless it is the default port for the protocol (e.g. http://www.abc.com, https://www.def.com:8888), but <strong>not paths or trailing slashes ("/")</strong></li>
	<li>Any key for your account may be used to access the account content via the Playback API, so if you are using domain restriction, we highly recommend that you domain restrict all of your players.</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<h3>Request body (full format)</h3>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Note: if you have been using the full format version of the request body, this syntax has been deprecated. Use the concise format shown above instead.</aside>
</section>

<section id="geoRestriction" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Geo restriction</h2>

<p>The Policy API can be used to implement geo-restriction for a player instead of or in addition to <a href="/node/18011">individual videos.</a></p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
<ul>
	<li>A policy may restrict playback based on the viewer's detected country. To create and use a key with this policy, the account must be permitted to use geo-restriction features. This policy will also deny access if the end-user appears to be making their request through or from an anonymizing proxy.</li>
	<li>Geo restrictions applied in a policy key are enforced <strong>only</strong> by players that use that policy key.</li>
	<li>Geo-restriction can also be <a href="/node/18011">applied to individual videos</a>. Video Cloud applies both player and video level geo-restriction policies, so if a country is excluded by either, the video will not be available in that country.</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<h3>Sample</h3>

<p>Here is an example whitelist policy set that only allows playback from the US and US territories and military bases:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{"account-id": "8523232323",
 "geo": {
   "countries": ["us", "usmil", "pr", "gu", "vi", "as", "mp"],
   "exclude_countries": false
 }
}</code></pre>

<p>To blacklist those countries instead, set <code>exclude_countries</code> to true.</p>
</section>
<!-- <p>You can also use the full format for the request body. In this format, you include a <code>policies</code> array of policy objects, which allow or deny access to the Playback API based on logical patterns. A <code>pattern</code> is an object whose only property is a logical operator. The following logical operators can be used:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>=</code> equals</li>
                        <li><code>!=</code> does not equal</li>
                        <li><code>contains?</code> contains</li>
                        <li><code>not-contains?</code> does not contain</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Logical operators can be combined using <code>and</code> or <code>or</code>.</p>
                    <p>The other property of a policy object is <code>effect</code>, which specifies whether those domains or accounts matching the pattern are allowed or denied access to the Playback API. The value will be either <code>allow</code> or <code>deny</code>.</p>
                    <p>Here is the full format version of the policy with domain restriction above:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-json">{
    "policies": [
        {
        "pattern": {
