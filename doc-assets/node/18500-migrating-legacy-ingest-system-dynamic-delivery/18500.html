    <p>If you want to understand how Dynamic Delivery works and the advantages of using it, see the <a href="/node/18476#faq">Overview of Dynamic Delivery</a>. This topic covers some things you will need to do after switching to Dynamic Delivery, particularly around the using of Dynamic Ingest.</p>

  <h2 id="Retranscoding_videos">Retranscoding videos</h2>
  <p>Existing videos in your account will not automatically be converted to Dynamic Delivery. To make that change, you will need to retranscode them. You can do this one-by-one in Studio, but the recommended way is to use the <a href="/node/17949#retranscode">Dynamic Ingest API</a> and use the <a href="/node/18439">low priority queue</a>. The advantage of this is that you can set up a simple app <a href="/node/18496">similar to this one</a> to retranscode all the videos. The low priority queue essentially has no limit, so you will not have to worry about throttling the app to keep the running job count under the limit. Low priority jobs will take longer to process, but that isn't an issue here - your videos will continue to be playable as they always have been until the retranscoding is complete.</p>

  <h2>Notifications</h2>

  <p>Notifications for Dynamic Delivery ingests are similar to ones for the legacy ingest but there are a few differences. If you have apps or integrations that depend on Dynamic Ingest notifications to trigger subsequent actions, you will probably need to modify them a little bit.</p>

  <p>Below are sample notifications for successful rendition completion for Dynamic Delivery an non-Dynamic Delivery ingests to highlight the differences.</p>

  <table class="bcls-table">
  	<caption class="bcls-caption--table">Dynamic Delivery and non-Dynamic Delivery Notifications</caption>
  	<thead class="bcls-table__head">
  		<tr>
  			<th>Dynamic Delivery Rendition Success</th>
  			<th>Non-Dynamic Delivery Rendition Success</th>
  		</tr>
  	</thead>
  	<tbody class="bcls-table__body">
  		<tr>
  			<td>
  			<pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-json">{
      "status": "SUCCESS",
      "entity": "5123312711001",
      <span class="bcls-highlight">"entityType": "DYNAMIC_RENDITION",</span>
      "version": "1",
      "action": "CREATE",
      "jobId": "48c3a283-40f9-4214-8c27-21e3a040ca6a",
      "videoId": "5123312711001",
      <span class="bcls-highlight">"dynamicRenditionId": "default/audio64",</span>
      "accountId": "57838016001"
  }</code></pre>
  			</td>
  			<td>
  			<pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-json">{
      <span class="bcls-highlight">"entityType": "ASSET",</span>
      "status": "SUCCESS",
      "version": "1",
      "jobId": "93d40db1-df3f-4023-bab6-51459cdda470",
      "videoId": "5122632511001",
      <span class="bcls-highlight">"profileRefId": "mp2",</span>
      "entity": "5122644754001",
      "action": "CREATE",
      "accountId": "57838016001"
  }</code></pre>
  			</td>
  		</tr>
  	</tbody>
  </table>

  <p>As you can see, the differences here are that the <code>entity_type</code> for Dynamic Delivery ingestion is <code>DYNAMIC_RENDITION</code> instead of <code>ASSET</code>, and you get a <code>dynamicRenditionId</code> instead of a <code>profileRefId</code></p>
