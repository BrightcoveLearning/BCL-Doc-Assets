    <p>Wireshark is a popular open source application for analyzing network protocols in much greater depth than you can achieve through, for example, the Network portion of browser developer tools. This can be very valuable for diagnosing problems with internet applications such as the Brightcove Player or apps that interact with with Brightcove through our APIs.</p>
    <p>Even if your own knowledge of networks is not deep enough to fully understand the information you obtain from Wireshark, capturing the information can be of great help to Brightcove Support in diagnosing issues, and our Support representatives may ask if it is possible for you to capture network data from Wireshark so that they can better help you.</p>
    <p>The steps below will walk you through the basic installation and use of Wireshark.</p>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> before beginning, it would be best to shut down as many applications that access the internet as possible (for example: email clients, IM or social media apps, Dropbox, Evernote, and other cloud-based storage apps). This will help minimize the "noise" of network transfers that are unrelated to the issue you are trying to diagnose.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Launch Wireshark.</li>
      <li>Select a capture filter - the one you want </li>
