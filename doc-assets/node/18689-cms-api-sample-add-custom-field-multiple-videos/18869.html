<p>Custom fields can be added to videos in the Media module, but you have to do that one by one. The sample app here allows you to add a custom field to as many as 10 videos at a time (and can be easily modified to increase that number or even add the custom field to all videos in the account). The app is fairly straightforward. The only challenge to creating a UI for custom fields is that they can take either a simple string for a value, or a selection from a list of values. That is not too difficult to manage, however, as you can easily tell from the field metadata which type of field it is and display the appropriate input field.</p>

<h2 id="proxy">Proxy code</h2>

<p>In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) A sample proxy, very similar to the one we use, but without the checks that block requests from non-Brightcove domains, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/sample-proxy-apps">this GitHub respository</a>. You will also find basic instructions for using it there, and a more elaborate guide to building apps around the proxy in <a href="/node/18132">Using the REST APIs</a>.</p>
