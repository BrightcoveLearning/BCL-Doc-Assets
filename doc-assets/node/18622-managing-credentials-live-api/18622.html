    <p>There are several kinds of credentials that can be used in conjunction with your Live API jobs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>FTP, S3, Video Cloud, or Zencoder credentials that the Live system needs to push clips to your chosen destination</li>
      <li>RTMP credentials that prevent someone who gets the RTMP address of your live steam from playing it back</li>
      <li>OAuth2 or basic authoritization credentials that the Live System needs to send notifications to your notication handler</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The credentials endpoints for the Live API allow to create and manage these credentials, which you can then reference by their labels when you create Live or VOD clip jobs.</p>
