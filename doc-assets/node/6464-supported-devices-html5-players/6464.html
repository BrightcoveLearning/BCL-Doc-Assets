<p>This topic is obsolete, since it applies only the <strong>legacy Smart Player</strong>, which is only <em>passively</em> supported on any platform and is scheduled for end of life at the end of 2017. Please see <a href="/node/18311">Player Feature Support by Browser</a> for information on features supported for the Brightcove Player on different browsers and platforms.</p>

<div style="opacity:.2">
    <p>All Video Cloud players run in Flash mode on any device or machine that has Flash Player version 10.1 + installed. Brightcove smart players can show your videos on devices that do not support the Flash player, or do not have the Flash player installed. All players are smart players if HTML5 delivery is enabled, but some functionality may not be present in the HTML5 player.</p>

<p>Video Cloud HTML5 players are supported on Apple and Android mobile devices only. Brightcove has tested our HTML5 players on the Apple and Android operating systems noted in this article, and supports only the operating systems in the <a href="#supportapple">Supported Apple OS versions</a> and the <a href="#supportandroid">Supported Android OS versions</a> tables. In addition, Brightcove has tested the HTML5 players in the native browsers of the Apple and Android operating systems and has not tested those OSes with any third party browser installed on those devices. Although Video Cloud videos might play well in HTML5 players for mobile operating systems not listed here, and in third-party browsers, we have not tested the HTML5 players in those environments, and therefore do not support them.</p>

<p>Support is defined in terms of the [major version].[minor version].[minor revision] of an OS (for example: iOS 5.1.1). There are two levels of support</p>

<ul>
	<li>Active: Brightcove&nbsp;will test and fix bugs on these OS versions.</li>
	<li>Passive: Brightcove will test on these OS versions, but bug fixes will be handled on a case by case basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, Brightcove provides active support for the versions of the OS that are used by 80% of the user base, and passive support for other versions used by at least 5% of the user base. Only the latest minor revision of a version is supported.</p>

<h2><a id="supportapple" name="supportapple" href=""></a>Supported Apple OS versions</h2>

<p>Brightcove tests and provides active support for Video Cloud HTML5 players in the native Safari browser for the following iOS operating systems:</p>

<ul>
	<li>9.0</li>
	<li>8.0</li>
	<li>7.0</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="supportandroid" name="supportandroid" href=""></a>Supported Android OS versions</h2>

<p>Brightcove provides active support for HTML5 players on the following Android versions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>6.0</li>
	<li>5.0</li>
	<li>4.4</li>
	<li>4.3</li>
	<li>4.2</li>
	<li>4.1</li>
	<li>4.0</li>
</ul>

<p>The Video Cloud HTML5 players rely on HTML5 support from the devices' native operating systems and browsers. Just as desktop operating systems and browser behavior varies, so does mobile browser support. For these reasons every feature of the HTML5 player might not work for one device or version as it does for another. See the <a href="node/10403#appleissues">Issues with supported Apple devices</a> and <a href="node/10403#androidissues">Issues with supported Android devices</a> sections of our Known Issues article for specific variations to HTML5 player behavior.</p>

<p>Note that Video Cloud videos will play in HTML5 players only if Flash is not installed on Android devices. If the Flash player is installed on an Android device, Video Cloud smart players assign the videos to play in Flash mode, and HTML 5 player support issues do not apply.</p>
