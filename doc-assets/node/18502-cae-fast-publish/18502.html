    <p>Fast publish allows you to use <a href="/node/18353">CAE</a> and still get videos online as quickly as possible by creating one or more static renditions which can be played immediately. The following conditions then apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As soon as dynamic renditions are available, they will be used rather than the static rendition for playback</li>
      <li>At some point after all the dynamic renditions have been processed, the static rendition(s) will be deleted automatically</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>In order to use fast publish, you must:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Have an account enabled for <a href="/node/17949">Dynamic Delivery</a></li>
      <li>Have the account enabled for <a href="/node/18353">CAE</a></li>
      <li>Create a custom CAE ingest profile using the <a href="/node/18374">Ingest Profiles API</a> (instructions <a href="#create_fast_publish_profile">below</a>)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="custom_profile_for_fast_publish">Custom profile for fast publish</h2>
    <p>Creating a custom profile enabled for fast publish is straightforward. It looks like a regular CAE profile, with one difference: in addition to a <code>renditions</code> array, the <code>dynamic_origin</code> object will contain a <code>temporary_renditions</code> array containing one or more fast publish renditions.</p>
    <p>The fast publish renditions are specified by name and <strong>must</strong> come from the list below (the number following <strong>video</strong> is the target bitrate for the rendition):</p>
    <!-- list is generated from scripts linked at bottom of page -->
    <ul id="renditionList"></ul>
    <p>Since the point of fast publish is to make a rendition available for playback as quickly as possible, it probably makes sense to use a low to mid-range bitrate for at least one of the temporary renditions.</p>
    <h3>Steps for creating a custom profile</h3>
    <p>Here are the steps for creating a custom fast publish profile with one temporary rendition. In the steps below, we will use the <a href="/node/18436#multi-platform-standard-dynamic"><code>multi-platform-standard-dynamic</code></a> standard profile as the basis for the custom profile, but you can use any of the <strong>CAE</strong> profiles.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">You can create as many custom profiles as you like using the procedure below, but we recommend only creating as many as your really need to avoid confusion and user errors.</aside>
