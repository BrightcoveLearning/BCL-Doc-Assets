Introduction

The Live API is a REST-based API that allows you to create and manage live streaming events. Optional features include:

Server-side ad insertion (SSAI )
AES-128 encryption
Create video-on-demand assets from clips taken from the live stream
DVR capability
Multiple CDNs
Base URL

The base URL for the Live API is:

https://api.bcovlive.io

Headers

All requests are authenticated using an API key that will be provided to you when your account is set up. The key is passed in an X-API-KEY header. A Content-Type header is also required:

X-API-KEY : YOUR_APIKey
Content-Type: application/json

Supported AWS regions

The following AWS regions are supported:

Oregon: us-west-2
Virginia: us-east-1 (limited SSAI support currently)
Tokyo: ap-northeast-1
Singapore: ap-southeast-1
Sydney: ap-southeast-2 (limited SSAI support currently)
Frankfurt: eu-central-1

Sao Paulo: sa-east-1 (no SSAI support currently)
Supported CDNs

The following CDNs are supported for live streaming:

Akamai
Cloudfront
Other file-based CDNs should work, but have not been tested and are not actively supported.

Channels and event hours

There are two purchasing options for Live:

Purchase event hours of streaming time
Purchase streaming channels
You may also purchase both event streaming hours and channels. Contact your account manager for more information on the offerings.

If you have purchased both event streaming hours and channels, you need to be aware of the following:
By default, live jobs are billed against event streaming hours
If you want a job to be billed as a channel job instead, you must include the following field in the request body when you create the live job:
"channel_type": "24x7"

Channel-only customers must always include the following field in the request body when you create the live job:
"channel_type": "24x7"

Token authentication

Brightcove offers the option of adding token authentication to live video stream playback URLs. If you would like to add token authentication, Contact Brightcove Support. It may take up to three days for token authentication to be set up.

The TTL (time-to-live) for the tokens can be set to any value from one hour to 365 days. How long you set the TTL will depend on what kinds of live streams you deploy. Be aware that the TTL is an account-wide setting, however, and will apply to all live streams.

DVR capability

Brightcove Live streams have DVR capability. To use this capability, you must:

Use the playback_url_dvr URL for playback
Use a player that has DVR capability
The DVR stream will remain available for 24 hours after the live stream is completed.

Endpoints and operations

The main operations for the Live API are creating and managing live streams, and generate VOD clips from live streams. These operations are carried out through requests to following endpoints, which are explained in more detail in the remainder of the document.

Note that Brightcove Live has its own account id, separate from any other account ids. In the API operations, account_id refers to your Live account id.
Creating and managing jobs

Creating and managing jobs

These operations allow you to create a live job, get the details of it, and stop it. There is also an endpoint to create an immediate cue point for an ad break.

Create a Live Job

POST https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/jobs
This endpoint is used to create live streams via a POST request. In addition to specifying properties of the live stream itself, the request can also specify VOD clips to be generated from the live stream (this can also be done later via the endpoint). Details of the fields that can be included in the request body are given in the API Reference.

The Live API Quick Start walks you through creating a live stream job and setting up a Brightcove Player to play it.

Get Live Job Details

GET https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/jobs/:jobId
This endpoint allows you to get the detailed information about a live stream, which is also returned when you originally create the job. See the API Reference for details of the response fields.

Manual Ad Cue Point Insertion

POST https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/jobs/:jobId/cuepoint
Typically your encoder will be sending cue points for ad breaks, but you can also create an immediate ad break by sending a request to this endpoint. See the API Reference for details.

Note that a timecode in the form DD:HH:MM:SS is required for the cue point.

Stop a Live Job

PUT https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/jobs/:jobId/cancel
Use this endpoint to stop a live stream immediately. Once cancelled, a live stream cannot be restarted. See the API Reference for details.

Creating clips

You can create video-on-demand clips from a live stream and store them in a Video Cloud account, or send them to S3 bucket or FTP address. You can define the clips when you create the live stream, or create them later using the endpoint described below. Also see the Creating Clips guide.

Create VOD Clip

POST https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/vods
The start and end points for the clips can be defined in terms of offsets from the start of the stream or UNIX timestamps. Details of the request body fields can be found in the API Reference.

Managing SSAI

Using server-side ad insertion (SSAI), you can insert as many ad breaks as you like into your live stream. You can also ingest slate assets (VOD clips) to fill any unused ad time with a be-right-back message or whatever you like.

More details of setting up SSAI can be found in Server-Side Ad Insertion Using the Brightcove Live API and the API Reference.

Get Account Ad Configurations

GET https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/ssai/applications/:account_id
This endpoint allows you to get all ad configurations that have been set up for an account. Details of the response fields can be found in the API Reference.

Create Ad Configuration

POST https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/ssai/application
Create an ad configuration that defines how ads will be retrieved for SSAI. Details of the request body fields can be found in the API Reference.

Get Ad Configuration

GET https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/ssai/application/:application_id
Use this endpoint to get the details of an ad configuration you have created. Details of the response fields can be found in the API Reference.

Update Ad Configuration

PUT https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/ssai/application/:application_id
Update the details of an ad configuration. Details of the request body fields can be found in the API Reference.

Get Slate Media Source Assets

GET https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/ssai/slates/:ACCOUNT_ID
Get the slate media assets that have been defined for an account. Slate media assets are used to fill ad break time that is not filled by ads. Details of the response fields can be found in the API Reference.

Ingest Slate Media Source Asset

POST https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/ssai/slates
Add a media asset for slates to fill unfilled ad break time. Details of the request body fields can be found in the API Reference.

Delete Slate Media Source Asset

DELETE https://api.bcovlive.io/v1/ssai/slates/:SLATE_MSA_ID
Deletes a slate media asset.

Static entry points

The Static Entry Points (SEP) feature allows for a long-running live job that can be activated and deactivated while keeping the entry point URLs and playback URLs static and re-usable. This feature allows for customers to configure their encoder in their facilities or the field and allows the customer to create their own scheduling logic for live channels or programs. See Static Entry Points for details.

Captions

If captions are inside the h264 input signal (correctly signaled in the user_data packet) those are passed through to the h264 outputs.

If you are using a broadcast Elemental live encoder you can get captions from SDI (EIA-608/CEA-608) or other sources (SCTE-20, SCC, Teletext, DVB-Sub, Ancillary, ARIB, TTML, SCTE-27, STL, SRT, SMI) and put them into the h264 stream that you send to us. Other broadcast grade encoders probably can do the same, but we have not formally tested them.

Limitations

Currently the framerate for input streams is limited to 30 FPS. If you are interested in using a higher frame rate, please contact Support.
By default the resolution of the input stream is limited to 1080p.
When disconnecting and reconnecting, the stream settings must stay the same. Any changes to the number of audio channels, resolutions, or codec settings will result in unpredictable behavior.
Although you can add DASH and MP4 for remote sources for Video Cloud videos, Live currently supports HLS only.
Only AAC audio is supported for input streams.
A maximum of 5 active waiting, unstarted jobs is allowed at any time. There is no limit on the number of live streams.
The "RTMP" address returned as the stream_url for Live jobs is an Akamai HD Live stream, not a legacy FMS RMTP stream - it is not supported by older versions of Internet Explorer.
If your account does not have HTTPS support for origin serving enabled, please Contact Brightcove Support to get HTTPS support for origin serving enabled to prevent playback issues.
