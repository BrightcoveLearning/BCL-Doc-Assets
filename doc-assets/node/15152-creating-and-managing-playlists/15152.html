<p>A playlist is a collection of videos that are grouped together in a particular order for playback in a player. The Media module makes it easy to create playlists and add videos to a playlist. After you've created your playlist, you can publish a playlist to a player. <span class="BCL-objective">For more information on publishing playlists, see <a href="/node/15473">Publishing Videos with the Media Module</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="BCL-objective">For more information about playlists, including best practices and tips for using them effectively, see <a href="/node/15475">Working with Playlists</a>.</span></p>

<h2 id="types">Types of playlists</h2>

<p>There are two types of playlists:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Manual</strong> - With a manual playlist, you assign specific videos to the playlist and re-order them manually.</li>
	<li><strong>Smart</strong> - With a smart playlist, the list of videos in the playlist is constructed automatically, based on video tags or other video properties. Smart playlists are dynamic and automatically update based upon the videos in your media library and the rules that define the playlist.</li>
</ul>

<p>A maximum of 100 videos can be added to a playlist (both Manual and Smart). Only the first 20 videos in a playlist are loaded into playlists for the Brightcove Player. The videos that are initially loaded into a playlist is determined by the type of playlist:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Manual Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the order of the videos in the manual playlist.</li>
	<li><strong>Smart Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the <strong>Play Order</strong> playlist setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on programmatically retrieving additional videos into a playlist, see the <a href="/node/18171">Playback API Paging</a> player sample.</p>
