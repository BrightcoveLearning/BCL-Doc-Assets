  <h2 id="Media_sharing_errors">Media Sharing Errors</h2>
  <p>Media sharing errors are not returned as a separate error response to the API request, but rather in an <code>error_message</code> field in the normal reponse:</p>
  <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-json">[
    {
      "video_id" : "394872349182374",
      "affiliate_id" : "234987239487",

      "error_message" : <span class="bcls-highlight">"[{"error_code":"MISSING_CUSTOM_FIELDS","error_message":"Affiliate account is missing custom fields: [whisky]"}]"</span>
    }
]</code></pre>
  <p>The <code>error_message</code> json will be an array of error objects, object will have <code>error_code</code> and <code>error_message</code>.</p>
  <h3><code>error_code</code></h3>
  <p>The error code will usually be sharing-specific but it could be any of the valid error codes that can be returned by a PATCH (update) operation on a video as well. The sharing specific error codes are shown in the table below.</p>

This might also mean the master account does not have a channel yet or if the affiliate account does not exist or is not a valid member of the channel.
