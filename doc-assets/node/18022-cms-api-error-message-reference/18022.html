  <h2 id="Media_sharing_errors">Media Sharing Errors</h2>
  <p>Media sharing errors are not returned as a separate error response to the API request, but rather in an <code>error_message</code> field in the normal reponse:</p>
  <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-json">[
    {
      "video_id" : "30308253597202",
      "affiliate_id" : "10930819",

      "status" : "COMPLETE",
      "shared_at" : "2017-12-11T17:57:45.530Z",
      "updated_at" : "2017-12-11T18:03:32.789Z",
      "error_message" : <span class="bcls-highlight">"[{"error_code":"MISSING_CUSTOM_FIELDS","error_message":"Affiliate account is missing custom fields: [whisky]"}]"</span>
    }
]</code></pre>
  <p>The <code>error_message</code> json will be an array of error objects, object will have <code>error_code</code> and <code>error_message</code>.</p>
  <h3><code>error_code</code></h3>
  <p>The error code will usually be sharing-specific but it could be any of the valid error codes that can be returned by a PATCH (update) operation on a video as well. The sharing specific error codes are shown in the table below.</p>
