<h2>Getting the data</h2>

<p>The Dynamic Ingest notifications give you all the information you need to know when your video is ready - you just need to know what to look for...and to define what "ready" means for your systems. This diagram summarizes the workflow:</p>

<h2>Dynamic Ingest Notifications</h2>

<p>The Dynamic Ingest notification service sends you notifications for several kinds of events. The three that are most useful for figuring out when the video is "ready" are ones indicating that particular renditions have been created, ones indicating that a manifest has been created, and the one that indicates that all processing is complete. Here are examples of each:</p>

<h3>Rendition created notification</h3>

<figure class="bcls-figure">
<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "entity": "5002412132001",
    <span class="bcls-highlight">"profileRefId": "ts7",</span>
    "accountId": "57838016001",
    "entityType": "ASSET",
    <span class="bcls-highlight">"videoId": "5002361893001",</span>
    <span class="bcls-highlight">"status": "SUCCESS",</span>
    "version": "1",
    "action": "CREATE",
    "jobId": "bb316631-c58b-4bd4-a686-13c5f7a3a779"
}</code></pre>

<figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Notification for Rendition Created</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note in this example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>videoId</code> value lets you know which video the rendition is for (in case you have multiple ingest jobs running)</li>
	<li>The <code>profileRefId</code> value is the reference id for the rendition specified in the ingest profile</li>
	<li>if the <code>status</code> value is "SUCCESS", the rendition was created successfully</li>
	<li>For a segmented type like HLS or MPEG-DASH, the existence of the rendition does not make it playable - you also need the appropriate manifest (see the next example). MP4 renditons are playable as soon as they are created.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Manifest created notification</h3>

<figure class="bcls-figure">
<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "jobId": "31f0b112-9890-4567-adb5-0f4ed1673701",
    <span class="bcls-highlight">"status": "SUCCESS",</span>
    "version": "1",
    "action": "CREATE",
    "entityType": "ASSET",
    "entity": "5002412528001",
    <span class="bcls-highlight">"videoId": "5002361895001",</span>
    <span class="bcls-highlight">"profileRefId": "HlsManifest",</span>
    "accountId": "57838016001"
}</code></pre>

<figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Notification for Manifest Created</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note in this example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>videoId</code> value lets you know which video the rendition is for (in case you have multiple ingest jobs running)</li>
	<li>The <code>profileRefId</code> value is a special code that tells you that the asset created was an HLS manifest (the other possible values are <code>HdsManifest</code>, <code>DashManifest</code>, and <code>SmoothIsmManifest</code>)</li>
	<li>For HLS and HDS, one manifest will be created, so you will see one notification. For DASH and SmoothIsm, two manifests are created (one for use in the legacy Media API, the other for the CMS API), so you will see two notifications of this type.</li>
	<li>If the <code>status</code> value is "SUCCESS", the manifest was created successfully</li>
	<li>For a segmented type like HLS or MPEG-DASH, there is no definite order for the creation of the renditions and manifest - these renditions are not playable until both are created (or the video has been fully processed - see the next example).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Processing complete notification</h3>

<figure class="bcls-figure">
<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    <span class="bcls-highlight">"entityType": "TITLE",</span>
    <span class="bcls-highlight">"status": "SUCCESS",</span>
    "accountId": "57838016001",
    "entity": "5002412652001",
    "action": "CREATE",
    "jobId": "3e98b3a0-f624-4f2d-81c1-4e43e1d04a0f",
    "version": "1",
    <span class="bcls-highlight">"videoId": "5002412652001"</span>
}</code></pre>

<figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Notification for Processing Complete</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note in this example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>videoId</code> value lets you know which video the rendition is for (in case you have multiple ingest jobs running)</li>
	<li>The <code>profileRefId</code> is <strong>not</strong> included in this notification</li>
	<li>If the <code>status</code> value is "SUCCESS", the video was processed successfully</li>
</ul>

<p>To receive notifications, you need to include a "callbacks" field in you Dynamic Ingest API requests, pointing to one or more callback addresses:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">{
    "master": {
        "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/mysourcevideo.mp4"
    }, "profile": "high-resolution",
    <strong>"callbacks": ["http://host1/path1”, “http://host2/path2”]</strong>
}</code></pre>

<h2>Sample Dashboard</h2>

<p>This section explains how notications can be put together to build a simple dashboard for the Dynamic Ingest API. The handler for notifications parses notifications from the Dynamic Ingest API to identify processing complete notifications. It then adds the video notifications into an array of objects for each video in a JSON file. The dashboard itself is an HTML page that imports the JSON file to get the notification data. It uses the ids to makes a request to the <a href="/node/18034">CMS API</a> to get the video metadata. You can view the dashboard <a href="//solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/di-api/di-log.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>All the files for this app, along with instructions for setting it up for your account, are in <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/dynamic-ingest-dashboard">this repository</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the high-level architecture of the app:</p>

<h3>The app parts</h3>

<p>The handler for notifications is built in PHP - it looks for processing complete notifications and adds the video id to an array in a separate JavaScript file:</p>

<h4>Notification handler</h4>

<pre data-src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/video-cloud-apis/general-information/di-status/callbacks-di.php" class="line-numbers">

&nbsp;</pre>
<!-- <p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/846bf4f1b8d52b442121.js"></script>
                    </p> -->

<h4>JSON file:</h4>

<p>The JSON file is initially an empty array (<code>[]</code>) - data is added by the notification handler.</p>

<h4>Dashboard</h4>

<p>The dashboard includes the HTML and JavaScript to fetch the notification data and additional video data from the CMS API and write the results into a table:</p>

<pre data-src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/video-cloud-apis/general-information/di-status/di-log.html" class="line-numbers">

&nbsp;</pre>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">There's a design choice to be made here: you can use the notification handler or the dash (or a combination of the two) to process the notications and extract the useful information. In this kind of app, we prefer to keep the notification handler simple, just using it to pass on the notification data, and let the cliet app (in this case the dashboard) do the information processing. This requires more processing on the client, but make the notification handler more reusable.</aside>

<h4>Proxy</h4>

<p>The proxy, also built in PHP, takes the CMS API requests from the dashboard, gets an access token, and makes the API request, returning the data to the dashboard. The proxy is needed because client-side calls to the CMS-API are not allowed, as this would require exposing your client credentials:</p>

<h4>Clear the log</h4>

<p>This simple PHP app just restores the JavaScript file to its original state, clearing out the old video ids:</p>
