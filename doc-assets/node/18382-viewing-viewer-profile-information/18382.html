<p>When using Audience Tracking or SSO integrations, viewer profiles will be created based upon the data that was used to identify the viewer. Viewer profiles allow you to view the viewing data for a given viewer.</p>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<p>All video views in Audience-enabled players will be tracked. To view the video activity, click<strong> Viewer Profile (non-MAP)</strong> in the left navigation. The Viewer Profiles page will display a list of all viewing activity from Audience tracking and SSO integrations for the selected time period. The calendar control can be used to select a new date range. The Viewer value will be the value that was used to identify the user. Typically, this will be the email address (captured on a lead form for Audience Tracking) or the GUID value used to identify the viewer on SSO integrations. Data can be sorted by clicking on the column headers.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside language-editable">Note: There will be a few hour delay before the viewing data will appear.</p>
