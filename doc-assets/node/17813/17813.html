<h2>Meaning</h2>

<p>There are two causes of this error. In the first case, it is the specified frame rate that is not supported. In general, frame rates greater than 300 fps are not allowed. Some codecs have frame rate limitations as well. For example, MPEG 4 has a limit of 65.5 fps.</p>

<p>The second cause of this error is an unsupported source file frame rate. Currently, the source rate must be less than 1000 fps. Typically, anything higher is due to invalid source metadata.</p>
