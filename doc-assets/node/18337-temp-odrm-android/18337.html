<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Native SDK for Android allows you to create mobile apps which include Offline playback of your video content, while keeping it secure with a <a href="http://www.widevine.com/wv_drm.html">Widevine Modular</a> solution. The Native SDK simplifies your implementation for download management, offline catalog management, analytics, offline playback and DRM.</p>

<p>
	The Offline playback feature is included in the latest version of the Brightcove Native SDK. For details, see the <a href="">Brightcove Native Player SDK for Android</a> reference.

<h2>Prepare videos</h2>
<p>For the SDKs to mark a video as downloadable, you need to use the <a href="/node/18034">CMS API</a> to set the <a href="/node/18023#videoFields">offline_enabled</a> field to a value of <strong>true</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is an example using curl:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="1">
<code class="language-json">curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $oauth_token" --request PATCH --data '
{"offline_enabled" : true}
' https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/<span class="bcls-input">your account id</span>/videos/<span class="bcls-input">your video id</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Setting this field will be similar to the steps found in the <a href="/node/18014">Setting 360-Video Properties with the CMS API</a> document.</p>

<section class="bcls-section" id="Notes">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>When the app is deleted, all downloaded content is removed. This is true as long as the default storage location is not overridden.</p>

<section class="bcls-section" id="Known_Issues">
<h2>Known issues</h2>

<p>The following known issues are related to offline playback with the Native SDK for Android.</p>

<h3>Intermittent Audio Problems During Playback or Seeking</h3>

<p>While playing downloaded content, intermittent audio dropouts may occur during playback, seeking and orientation changes of the device. This issue does not persist for more than a few seconds as the player recovers. When this happens, the following will be written to the logcat:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-java">04-18 19:03:46.934 28764-28764/com.brightcove.player.test E/ExoPlayerVideoDisplayComponent: onAudioTrackUnderrun: bufferSize = 48000, bufferSizeMs = 250, elapsedSinceLastFeedMs = 1766</code></pre>

<p>Audio problems did not occur when selecting another downloaded video or when going back to the original downloaded video.</p>

<h3>Download File Management: Download Cancellation and Deletion</h3>

<p>Canceling and deleting downloaded videos can sometimes fail to entirely clean up a download directory.</p>

<p>It is recommended that if a deleted video download is not entirely removed from the device, that it is possible to delete the remainder of the download through the <strong>Storage</strong> section of the <strong>Settings</strong> on the device.</p>

<h3>Overriding the Download Directory</h3>
<p>For now, overriding the download directory is not supported.</p>
