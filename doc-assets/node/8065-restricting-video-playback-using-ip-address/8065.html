		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>In order to limit video playback to internal viewers only, Video&nbsp;Cloud Enterprise publishers can use IP address restriction. This approach prevents all the players in an account from loading unless the browser loading the player uses one of a specified list (whitelist) of allowed IP addresses. This provides a level of security that goes beyond <a href="node/15616#domains">domain restriction</a> or <a href="node/15616#geofilter">geo-restriction</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>When you set up IP address restriction, it applies to all the players in that account. You will need to use a separate account for players and videos that you want to make publicly available.
	  </p>
	  <p>When a user tries to load a page that contains a Video Cloud player from an address that is not on the whitelist, they will see an error message that says "The video you are trying to watch cannot be viewed from your current country or location."

		<h2>How to set up IP address restriction</h2>
		<p>To set up IP address restriction for one of your Video Cloud accounts, contact <a href="http://support.brightcove.com/en/contact">Brightcove Support</a>. You will need to work with Support to identify or create an account for this purpose and provide a text file that contains your IP address whitelist.
  </p>

	<section id="Creating_an_IP_address_whitelist" class="bcls-section">
		<h2>Creating an IP address whitelist</h2>
		<p>To set up IP address restriction for one of your Video Cloud accounts, you need to provide Brightcove Support with a whitelist of the IP addresses that should be allowed to load Video Cloud players. Most companies use one or more gateways through which internal corporate traffic reaches the outside Internet.&nbsp;Your IP address whitelist should include the IP addresses of all of these gateways.
	  </p>
	  <p>The whitelist should include each IP address on a separate line. You can also include a range of IP addresses. For example:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
38.39.23.40
38.39.23.48
38.39.23.50-38.112.23.69
38.39.23.100-38.112.23.199</pre>
	  <p>You can also use <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR block notation</a>, such as:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
38.39.23.50|38</pre>
	  <p>or
	  </p>
	  <pre>
38.39.23.50/38</pre>

	<section id="Video_Cloud_content" class="bcls-section">
		<h2>Video Cloud content</h2>
		<p>When using the Playback API to retrieve content from a Video Cloud account which is configured for IP restrictions, you must use the following instead of the standard URL:</p>
<pre>
<code>https://edge-elb.api.brightcove.com/playback/v1</code></pre>
		<p>
		  Use <code>edge-elb.api...</code> vs the normal <code>edge.api...</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		  For more details, see the <a href="/node/17906">Playback API Overview</a> document.
