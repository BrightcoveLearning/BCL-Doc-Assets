<h2 class="BCL_conceptTitle" id="data">Developing with Android Studio</h2>

<p>Working in an application environment is extremely technical, so it is critical that we stay up to date with all the latest industry standards. <a href="https://developer.android.com/intl/es/sdk/index.html">Android Studio</a> is the official IDE for Android developers and <a href="//android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/06/an-update-on-eclipse-android-developer.html">Google has made it clear</a> that it is time to migrate if youâ€™re still using Eclipse.</p>

<p>The Brightcove SDK teams are committed to providing customers with the simplest and most efficient means to bring our video player SDK into your applications. Removing the error-prone and time-consuming process of working with Eclipse allows us to focus on providing a superior experience through <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> with <a href="https://developer.android.com/intl/es/sdk/index.html">Android Studio</a>.</p>
