<p>Media sharing is a feature of Video Cloud that lets publishers share videos with other publishers, enabling you to more easily manage videos across multiple accounts. For example, publishers can keep a master account of video content and then share videos out to other divisions or subsidiaries of the organization.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"><strong>Media sharing is available only for Video Cloud Enterprise and Pro customers with multiple accounts.</strong> If you are interested in upgrading your Video Cloud account, please contact Brightcove for more information.</aside>
